# Activity Summary for 19/10/2025

## 19:00:35
The logs detail changes across three files, primarily focusing on a Solidity smart contract for an optimistic oracle and two related React components for visualization and proof checking.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/contracts/contracts/SimpleOracleAdapter.sol`**
    *   **Timestamp:** The file content remained identical across multiple timestamps from **19/10/2025, 17:02:30** to **19/10/2025, 17:16:17**.
    *   **Content:** This Solidity smart contract (`SimpleOracleAdapter`) implements an optimistic oracle designed for networks lacking Chainlink support. Its core functionality includes:
        *   **Optimistic Proof Verification:** Proofs are optimistically accepted, subject to a `CHALLENGE_PERIOD` of 24 hours. State variables track proof timestamps, verification status, and disputed proofs.
        *   **On-chain TLE Validation:** The contract provides a `validateTLE` function to perform comprehensive Two-Line Element (TLE) format and checksum validation directly on-chain, utilizing a cache for efficiency.
        *   **Events and Errors:** Defines events for `ProofSubmitted`, `ProofDisputed`, `ProofVerified`, and `TLEValidated`, along with custom error types for invalid TLEs or proof disputes.
        *   **Admin Functions:** Includes an `Ownable` modifier and a `disputeProof` function (partially shown) for the owner to challenge fraudulent proofs within the challenge window.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/components/marketplace-globe.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** The file content also remained identical across timestamps from **19/10/2025, 17:16:34** to **19/10/2025, 17:17:11**.
    *   **Content:** This React component (`MarketplaceGlobe`) uses `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` to render an interactive 3D globe.
        *   It displays a rotating Earth with an `earthTexture`.
        *   `Marker` components are used to plot "nodes" (likely ground stations or satellites) on the globe, converting latitude/longitude to Cartesian coordinates. These markers have labels and are clickable.
        *   It includes `OrbitControls` for user interaction (pan, zoom, rotate).

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/components/proof-status.tsx`**
    *   **Significant Change Timestamp:** This file shows a major change occurring between **19/10/2025, 17:24:30** (last log of the old version) and **19/10/2025, 17:25:01** (first log of the new version).
    *   **Initial Version (until 17:24:30):**
        *   This React component was a "Proof Checker" designed for **on-chain interaction**.
        *   It used `ethers.js` to connect to a Web3 provider (e.g., MetaMask) and an `SimpleOracleAdapter` contract.
        *   It allowed users to input proof details (hash, timestamp, node ID, satellite ID) and would query the oracle contract to determine the proof's status (finalized, disputed, verified, pending).
        *   It computed `proofId` using `ethers.solidityPackedKeccak256` and could convert raw text proof hashes to `bytes32` SHA-256 hashes.
    *   **Later Version (from 17:25:01):**
        *   The component was refactored and simplified to a "Proof Checker (UI-only)", explicitly removing all blockchain interaction.
        *   It no longer uses `ethers.js` or connects to a smart contract.
        *   Its sole function became the **client-side computation of a SHA-256 hash** for a given proof text or hex input.
        *   The UI was updated to reflect this change, replacing "Check Status" with "Compute SHA-256" and adding a disclaimer about the UI-only nature of the tool, noting that on-chain integration would be for a later phase.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Repetitive Logging:** A consistent pattern across the `SimpleOracleAdapter.sol` and `marketplace-globe.tsx` files is the numerous log entries showing identical code content over short time intervals. This suggests frequent saving or committing without substantive code changes during those specific periods.
*   **Blockchain Application Development:** The log illustrates typical components of a blockchain application: a core smart contract (Solidity) defining the business logic and two front-end components (React/TypeScript) for user interaction and data visualization.
*   **Hashing Mechanisms:** Both the Solidity contract and the React `proof-status.tsx` component (in both its versions) heavily rely on cryptographic hashing (Keccak-256 for on-chain `proofId` and SHA-256 for proof data) for data integrity and unique identification.
*   **Optimistic Design Principles:** The `SimpleOracleAdapter.sol` contract clearly follows an optimistic verification model, where proofs are accepted but can be challenged within a specified period, a common pattern in blockchain scaling solutions and oracles.
