The content of the `universityRoutes.ts` file defines an extensive API surface for a university backend, covering a broad range of functionalities. Key aspects include:

*   **Authentication and Validation:** All routes are protected by `authMiddleware` and `verifyUser`. Many POST requests incorporate `validationMiddleware` using predefined schemas.
*   **University Profile Management:** Endpoints for fetching, creating, and updating a university's profile.
*   **Campus Drives Management:** Routes for creating, listing, and deleting campus drives, inviting recruiters, updating drive status, and managing student registration/unregistration for drives.
*   **Job Approvals:** Functionality to list pending jobs and approve or reject job applications.
*   **Comprehensive Analytics:** A significant portion of the routes are dedicated to analytics, including:
    *   Overall university summary and trends.
    *   Advanced metrics like placement data, department performance, skill distribution, career readiness, recruiter engagement, student career tracking, salary distribution, placement trends, and top recruiters.
    *   Specific drive analytics.
*   **Public Access:** An endpoint to list universities for student selection.
*   **Student Onboarding:** Support for bulk importing students via CSV using `uploadCsvMiddleware`.
*   **Communication:** A route for broadcasting notifications.
*   **Talent Showcase:** Management of student talent highlights (listing, adding, removing).
*   **Partners Management:** CRUD operations for university partners.
*   **Events Management:** Full CRUD operations for events, including retrieving event participants.
*   **Competitions Management:** Listing competitions and fetching leaderboards.
*   **Training & Course Insights:** Analytics related to training completion, student progress, skill gaps, certifications, and popular courses.
*   **Settings & Configuration:** Routes for retrieving and updating university settings.
*   **Reports Generation:** A comprehensive set of endpoints for listing, generating, retrieving, downloading, scheduling, and deleting various reports.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modular Structure:** The routes are well-organized with clear comments delineating different functional areas.
*   **RESTful Design:** Consistent use of HTTP methods (GET for retrieval, POST for creation, PUT for updates, DELETE for removal) where appropriate.
*   **Controller Delegation:** All route logic is delegated to functions within `universityController`, promoting separation of concerns.
*   **Middleware Usage:** Heavy reliance on custom middlewares for authentication, validation, and file uploads.
*   **Focus on Data and Analytics:** A recurring theme is the extensive provision of data retrieval and analytical endpoints across various domains (students, placements, drives, training).
