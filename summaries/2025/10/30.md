# Activity Summary for 30/10/2025

## 00:24:11
The code changes detail active development across several core components of a blockchain-based payment system, "WattsPay," with a strong focus on Aptos blockchain integration and WebAuthn for enhanced security.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/.env`**
    *   **29/10/2025, 14:52:03 - 14:52:22**: Initial configurations for Node.js, Twilio, Aptos (testnet), smart contract addresses, and security settings were present.
    *   **29/10/2025, 15:54:39**: The Aptos network configuration was temporarily switched from `testnet` to `devnet`, accompanied by updates to smart contract addresses.
    *   **29/10/2025, 15:54:51**: The `APTOS_NETWORK` reverted to `testnet`, but the smart contract addresses remained configured for `devnet`, indicating a temporary inconsistency.
    *   **29/10/2025, 15:59:21**: Smart contract addresses were corrected to match the `testnet` environment, resolving the prior inconsistency.
    *   **29/10/2025, 16:10:38**: A significant overhaul of the environment variables occurred. The `FRONTEND_URL` was updated to a devtunnel address. Key placeholders for `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` were explicitly set. Twilio account credentials were updated, and `APTOS_API_KEY` and `TESTNET_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY` were re-added. Configuration blocks for different Aptos networks and contract addresses were commented out or consolidated, with detailed deployment notes for TestNet contracts. Additional commented-out entries for webhook URLs, database connection strings (Neon.tech), and a test phone number were introduced, suggesting plans for production deployment and new features.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/index.ts`**
    *   **29/10/2025, 14:53:47 - 15:02:01**: This file initializes the Express application, sets up CORS headers, mounts WebAuthn routes, and defines the primary `/webhook/whatsapp` endpoint for processing messages. It includes logic for user onboarding (wallet creation/import), command parsing (`create`, `import`, `receive`, `help`, `balance`, `history`, `send`), and session management.
    *   **29/10/2025, 15:05:57**: The CORS headers were expanded to include `Authorization`, and a `type: 'payment'` field was added to the payload saved during a `send` command confirmation. A new import for `requestRefund` was also added.
    *   **29/10/2025, 15:07:46**: These changes were temporarily reverted, removing `Authorization` from CORS, the `requestRefund` import, and the `type: 'payment'` field.
    *   **29/10/2025, 15:11:29**: The changes from 15:05:57 were re-applied, restoring `Authorization` in CORS, the `requestRefund` import, and the `type: 'payment'` field to the confirmation payload.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/server/webauthnController.ts`**
    *   **29/10/2025, 15:02:53**: This controller implements WebAuthn registration and authentication flows, managing challenges, persisting public key credentials, and re-encrypting user wallets with WebAuthn-derived keys. It utilizes an in-memory store for challenges and includes utility functions for Base64 URL conversions and determining the Relying Party ID.
    *   **29/10/2025, 15:06:36**: Several functionalities were temporarily removed or simplified: the `crypto` module import, wallet re-encryption logic, a specific `devtunnels.ms` hostname handling in `getRpIdAndOrigin`, the `-257` (RS256) algorithm ID for WebAuthn, and console logging related to challenges. Payment payload handling after assertion verification was also removed.
    *   **29/10/2025, 15:06:58**: All changes from 15:06:36 were reverted, restoring the removed imports, the wallet re-encryption logic, the `devtunnels.ms` hostname handling, the `-257` algorithm ID, the console logging, and the payment payload handling.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/.env`**
    *   **29/10/2025, 16:11:26 - 16:11:37**: The `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` variable was adjusted by removing a trailing slash from the devtunnel URL.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/scripts/seed-phone-wallet.ts`**
    *   **29/10/2025, 16:14:09**: An initial script was added for seeding users with wallets, including options to fund the wallet and register the user on-chain.
    *   **29/10/2025, 16:17:47**: Import paths for `provisionWallet`, `fundWalletForRegistration`, and `registerUserOnChain` were consolidated to use a new barrel file (`../wallet`).
    *   **29/10/2025, 16:22:12**: This script underwent a significant refactor. The `fundWalletForRegistration` function was replaced with a new, local `fundWallet` function that directly uses the Aptos SDK and `TESTNET_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY` from environment variables for funding, streamlining the process within the script.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/wallet/index.ts`**
    *   **29/10/2025, 16:18:36**: This file was introduced as a barrel file, re-exporting functionalities from `walletService`, `paymentService`, and `groupPaymentService`, promoting modularity and cleaner import statements.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/wallet/groupPaymentService.ts`**
    *   **29/10/2025, 16:26:28**: A new service was introduced to handle group payment sessions. It defines interfaces and functions for creating group payment requests, validating participants, calculating individual amounts, and executing payments from members to the session creator. It also includes advanced interfaces for debt tracking and optimal settlement, indicating a sophisticated approach to managing shared expenses.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/wallet/walletService.js` and `src/wallet/walletService.ts`**
    *   **29/10/2025, 16:27:29 - 16:29:31**: These files define the core logic for wallet management, including `registerUserOnChain` (using a user registry contract), `provisionWallet` (generating Aptos accounts, encrypting private keys), `getWalletBalance` (fetching balances and normalizing Aptos addresses), `exportWalletMnemonic` (generating a mnemonic-like representation from encrypted private keys), and `getWalletTransactionHistory`. The `exportWalletMnemonic` includes a note about a simplified approach for production.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Development & Debugging:** Frequent, often short-lived, changes and reversions (e.g., in `index.ts` CORS headers, `webauthnController.ts` features) suggest an active development process involving experimentation, testing, and debugging. Console logs are used heavily in `webauthnController.ts` for tracing.
*   **Aptos Blockchain Integration:** The project is deeply integrated with the Aptos blockchain, evidenced by the use of `@aptos-labs/ts-sdk`, Aptos-specific client (`aptosClient`), and the management of Aptos network configurations and smart contract addresses in the `.env` file and `walletService`.
*   **Security Focus:** WebAuthn integration is a major feature, providing secure authentication and potential wallet re-encryption. Private key encryption is central to `walletService`.
*   **Modularity and Organization:** The introduction of `src/wallet/index.ts` indicates an effort to improve code structure and maintainability by consolidating exports.
*   **Wallet and Payment Feature Expansion:** The addition of `groupPaymentService.ts` points to an expansion of payment functionalities beyond simple transfers to include more complex group financial management.
*   **Configuration Management:** The `.env` file is a central point for managing various environment-specific settings, including sensitive credentials, which were consistently updated and adjusted throughout the log.
