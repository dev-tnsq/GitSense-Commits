    *   **29/10/2025, 14:52:03 - 14:52:22**: Initial configurations for Node.js, Twilio, Aptos (testnet), smart contract addresses, and security settings were present.
    *   **29/10/2025, 15:54:39**: The Aptos network configuration was temporarily switched from `testnet` to `devnet`, accompanied by updates to smart contract addresses.
    *   **29/10/2025, 15:54:51**: The `APTOS_NETWORK` reverted to `testnet`, but the smart contract addresses remained configured for `devnet`, indicating a temporary inconsistency.
    *   **29/10/2025, 15:59:21**: Smart contract addresses were corrected to match the `testnet` environment, resolving the prior inconsistency.
    *   **29/10/2025, 16:10:38**: A significant overhaul of the environment variables occurred. The `FRONTEND_URL` was updated to a devtunnel address. Key placeholders for `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` were explicitly set. Twilio account credentials were updated, and `APTOS_API_KEY` and `TESTNET_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY` were re-added. Configuration blocks for different Aptos networks and contract addresses were commented out or consolidated, with detailed deployment notes for TestNet contracts. Additional commented-out entries for webhook URLs, database connection strings (Neon.tech), and a test phone number were introduced, suggesting plans for production deployment and new features.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/index.ts`**
    *   **29/10/2025, 14:53:47 - 15:02:01**: This file initializes the Express application, sets up CORS headers, mounts WebAuthn routes, and defines the primary `/webhook/whatsapp` endpoint for processing messages. It includes logic for user onboarding (wallet creation/import), command parsing (`create`, `import`, `receive`, `help`, `balance`, `history`, `send`), and session management.
    *   **29/10/2025, 15:05:57**: The CORS headers were expanded to include `Authorization`, and a `type: 'payment'` field was added to the payload saved during a `send` command confirmation. A new import for `requestRefund` was also added.
    *   **29/10/2025, 15:07:46**: These changes were temporarily reverted, removing `Authorization` from CORS, the `requestRefund` import, and the `type: 'payment'` field.
    *   **29/10/2025, 15:11:29**: The changes from 15:05:57 were re-applied, restoring `Authorization` in CORS, the `requestRefund` import, and the `type: 'payment'` field to the confirmation payload.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/server/webauthnController.ts`**
    *   **29/10/2025, 15:02:53**: This controller implements WebAuthn registration and authentication flows, managing challenges, persisting public key credentials, and re-encrypting user wallets with WebAuthn-derived keys. It utilizes an in-memory store for challenges and includes utility functions for Base64 URL conversions and determining the Relying Party ID.
    *   **29/10/2025, 15:06:36**: Several functionalities were temporarily removed or simplified: the `crypto` module import, wallet re-encryption logic, a specific `devtunnels.ms` hostname handling in `getRpIdAndOrigin`, the `-257` (RS256) algorithm ID for WebAuthn, and console logging related to challenges. Payment payload handling after assertion verification was also removed.
    *   **29/10/2025, 15:06:58**: All changes from 15:06:36 were reverted, restoring the removed imports, the wallet re-encryption logic, the `devtunnels.ms` hostname handling, the `-257` algorithm ID, the console logging, and the payment payload handling.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/.env`**
    *   **29/10/2025, 16:11:26 - 16:11:37**: The `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` variable was adjusted by removing a trailing slash from the devtunnel URL.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/scripts/seed-phone-wallet.ts`**
    *   **29/10/2025, 16:14:09**: An initial script was added for seeding users with wallets, including options to fund the wallet and register the user on-chain.
    *   **29/10/2025, 16:17:47**: Import paths for `provisionWallet`, `fundWalletForRegistration`, and `registerUserOnChain` were consolidated to use a new barrel file (`../wallet`).
    *   **29/10/2025, 16:22:12**: This script underwent a significant refactor. The `fundWalletForRegistration` function was replaced with a new, local `fundWallet` function that directly uses the Aptos SDK and `TESTNET_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY` from environment variables for funding, streamlining the process within the script.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/wallet/index.ts`**
    *   **29/10/2025, 16:18:36**: This file was introduced as a barrel file, re-exporting functionalities from `walletService`, `paymentService`, and `groupPaymentService`, promoting modularity and cleaner import statements.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/wallet/groupPaymentService.ts`**
    *   **29/10/2025, 16:26:28**: A new service was introduced to handle group payment sessions. It defines interfaces and functions for creating group payment requests, validating participants, calculating individual amounts, and executing payments from members to the session creator. It also includes advanced interfaces for debt tracking and optimal settlement, indicating a sophisticated approach to managing shared expenses.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/wallet/walletService.js` and `src/wallet/walletService.ts`**
    *   **29/10/2025, 16:27:29 - 16:29:31**: These files define the core logic for wallet management, including `registerUserOnChain` (using a user registry contract), `provisionWallet` (generating Aptos accounts, encrypting private keys), `getWalletBalance` (fetching balances and normalizing Aptos addresses), `exportWalletMnemonic` (generating a mnemonic-like representation from encrypted private keys), and `getWalletTransactionHistory`. The `exportWalletMnemonic` includes a note about a simplified approach for production.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Development & Debugging:** Frequent, often short-lived, changes and reversions (e.g., in `index.ts` CORS headers, `webauthnController.ts` features) suggest an active development process involving experimentation, testing, and debugging. Console logs are used heavily in `webauthnController.ts` for tracing.
*   **Aptos Blockchain Integration:** The project is deeply integrated with the Aptos blockchain, evidenced by the use of `@aptos-labs/ts-sdk`, Aptos-specific client (`aptosClient`), and the management of Aptos network configurations and smart contract addresses in the `.env` file and `walletService`.
*   **Security Focus:** WebAuthn integration is a major feature, providing secure authentication and potential wallet re-encryption. Private key encryption is central to `walletService`.
*   **Modularity and Organization:** The introduction of `src/wallet/index.ts` indicates an effort to improve code structure and maintainability by consolidating exports.
*   **Wallet and Payment Feature Expansion:** The addition of `groupPaymentService.ts` points to an expansion of payment functionalities beyond simple transfers to include more complex group financial management.
*   **Configuration Management:** The `.env` file is a central point for managing various environment-specific settings, including sensitive credentials, which were consistently updated and adjusted throughout the log.

The changes in the log primarily focus on the backend services for a blockchain-based payment system integrated with WhatsApp and WebAuthn.

**Key File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/index.ts`**: This main Express application file shows continuous refinement.
    *   **Initial Setup (29/10/2025, 14:53:47)**: Established core server infrastructure, including CORS, WebAuthn routes, database connection initialization, and a Twilio WhatsApp webhook endpoint. The webhook processes incoming messages to onboard new users (providing links for wallet creation/import) and handles various wallet commands like `create`, `import`, `receive`, `help`, `balance`, `history`, and `send` (which initiates a confirmation flow).
    *   **CORS and Payment Payload Adjustments (29/10/2025, 15:05:57 - 15:11:29)**: This file underwent several rapid modifications and reverts.
        *   At 15:05:57, `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` in CORS was updated to include `'Authorization'`, the `requestRefund` function was imported, and the `send` command's confirmation payload began including `type: 'payment'`.
        *   By 15:07:46, `Authorization` was removed from CORS headers, `requestRefund` import was removed, and `type: 'payment'` was no longer included in the `send` command's payload.
        *   Finally, by 15:11:29, all these changes were reverted, restoring `Authorization` in CORS, re-adding `requestRefund` import, and re-including `type: 'payment'` in the payload. This indicates active iteration and potential indecision or testing regarding API security and payment flow data structure.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/server/webauthnController.ts`**: This file handles WebAuthn registration and authentication.
    *   **Initial Implementation (29/10/2025, 15:02:53)**: Introduced endpoints for generating WebAuthn registration and authentication options, and verifying responses. It includes logic for storing in-memory challenges, persisting WebAuthn credential metadata in the database, and crucially, re-encrypting user wallets with a WebAuthn-derived key after successful registration. It also contained specific logic for handling `devtunnels.ms` as an RP ID.
    *   **Brief Simplification and Revert (29/10/2025, 15:06:36 - 15:06:58)**: At 15:06:36, there was a significant attempt to simplify the WebAuthn process by removing imports related to private key encryption (`crypto`, `decryptString`, `encryptWalletWithWebAuthn`), removing the `requestRefund` import, simplifying `getRpIdAndOrigin` by removing `devtunnels.ms` specific logic, and entirely removing the wallet re-encryption step from the registration verification. However, these changes were swiftly reverted at 15:06:58, bringing the file back to its more feature-rich state concerning WebAuthn-based wallet encryption.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/scripts/seed-phone-wallet.ts`**: A utility script for testing.
    *   **Initial Functionality (29/10/2025, 16:14:09)**: Provided a script to create a user, provision an Aptos wallet, fund it with a small amount of APT, and register the user on the blockchain. It initially imported funding and registration logic from `../wallet/walletService`.
    *   **Import Restructuring (29/10/2025, 16:17:47)**: Imports for wallet services were updated to point to a consolidated `../wallet` index file, suggesting a modularization effort.
    *   **Custom Funding Logic (29/10/2025, 16:22:12)**: The script was significantly refactored to remove the dependency on `fundWalletForRegistration` from `walletService`. Instead, a new internal `fundWallet` function was implemented, directly using the Aptos SDK (`@aptos-labs/ts-sdk`) and an environment-configured `TESTNET_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY` to perform coin transfers. This change indicates a move towards more direct and controlled funding for test scenarios.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/wallet/index.ts`**: This new file acts as an aggregator.
    *   **Introduction (29/10/2025, 16:18:36)**: This file was created to re-export functions and types from `walletService`, `paymentService`, and `groupPaymentService`, simplifying module imports across the project.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/wallet/groupPaymentService.ts`**: A new service was introduced.
    *   **New Group Payment Feature (29/10/2025, 16:26:28)**: This file defines a comprehensive service for managing group payments. It includes interfaces for payment requests, results, transaction outcomes, and advanced debt tracking. Key functions `createGroupPayment` and `executeGroupPayment` handle validating participants, creating session reservations, splitting amounts, and executing individual payments from members to the group creator, ensuring database linkage and robust error handling.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/wallet/walletService.ts`**: This core wallet logic file.
    *   **Initial Implementation (29/10/2025, 16:29:31)**: Provided functions for `registerUserOnChain` (signing Aptos transactions), `provisionWallet` (generating, encrypting, and storing private keys), `getWalletBalance` (fetching APT balances with address normalization), `exportWalletMnemonic`, and `getWalletTransactionHistory`. It uses Aptos SDK, encryption utilities, and Prisma.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Aptos Blockchain Integration:** The project heavily relies on the Aptos blockchain, with explicit use of `@aptos-labs/ts-sdk` for account generation, transaction building, and on-chain interactions (e.g., user registration, funding, balance checks). Environment variables are used to configure Aptos network details (testnet/devnet) and smart contract addresses.
*   **WhatsApp as Primary Interface:** The `index.ts` file's central role as a Twilio webhook handler for WhatsApp messages confirms that WhatsApp is the primary user interface for interacting with the wallet functionalities.
*   **WebAuthn for Enhanced Security:** WebAuthn (passkey) integration is a significant security feature, used for both registration and authentication, including re-encrypting sensitive wallet private keys. The rapid changes and reverts around its encryption integration indicate a strong focus on secure key management.
*   **Modular Architecture:** The introduction of `src/wallet/index.ts` demonstrates an effort to consolidate and simplify module imports, improving code organization.
*   **Prisma ORM for Data Management:** Prisma is consistently used across various services and scripts for database operations, managing users, wallets, transactions, group sessions, and WebAuthn credentials.
*   **Comprehensive Wallet Features:** The codebase provides robust wallet functionalities including provisioning, balance checking, transaction history, and payments. The addition of `groupPaymentService` extends this to more complex multi-user financial interactions.
*   **Emphasis on Logging and Error Handling:** The consistent use of `logger` and custom error classes (`AppError`, `NotFoundError`, `ValidationError`) throughout new and modified files highlights a commitment to observability and resilient error management.
