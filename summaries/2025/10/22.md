The last significant update captured by this log is on 22/10/2025 at 00:03:14.

The `whats-pay-unified.clar` contract is a core component of a WhatsPay unified payments system designed for the Stacks blockchain.

**Key File-Specific Information:**

*   **Purpose:** The contract implements a complete payment system supporting P2P, Group Split, Escrow, and Pending Payments. A central feature is its support for making all payments using phone hashes, and it handles both STX and sBTC tokens (specifically 'ST1F7QA2MDF17S807EPA36TSS8AMEFY4KA9TVGWXT.sbtc-token' on a testnet).
*   **Token Trait:** It defines the `sip-010-trait` for standard fungible token operations.
*   **Constants:** Includes definitions for the `CONTRACT_OWNER`, `STX_TOKEN`, `SBTC_CONTRACT`, a comprehensive list of error codes (e.g., `ERR_UNAUTHORIZED`, `ERR_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`, `ERR_PHONE_NOT_REGISTERED`), and status codes (`STATUS_PENDING`, `STATUS_COMPLETED`, `STATUS_CANCELLED`, `STATUS_REFUNDED`). It also sets timeouts for pending and escrow payments (e.g., `PENDING_TIMEOUT` for 24 hours, `ESCROW_TIMEOUT` for 7 days).
*   **Data Variables:** Manages nonces for various payment types (`payment-id-nonce`, `group-split-id-nonce`, `escrow-id-nonce`, `pending-payment-id-nonce`) and holds the address of the `registry-contract` for phone hash lookups.
*   **Data Maps:** Several maps are used to store payment-related data:
    *   `payment-history`: Records general payment details for tracking.
    *   `p2p-payments`: Specifically for claim-based P2P payments, tracking sender, recipient, amount, status, timestamps, and memo.
    *   `group-splits`: Stores details for group payment splits, including creator, total/per-person amounts, participants, contributions, and status.
    *   `escrows`: Manages escrow agreements, storing buyer, seller, amount, status, timestamps, and description.
    *   `pending-payments`: Handles payments to unregistered recipients via phone hashes, allowing them to be claimed later.
*   **Registry Integration:**
    *   `set-registry-contract`: A public function, restricted to the contract owner, to set the address of the registry contract responsible for resolving phone hashes.
    *   `resolve-phone-hash`: A private helper function that dynamically calls the configured `whats-pay-registry-v5` contract to retrieve a wallet address from a phone hash.
*   **Token Transfer Logic:**
    *   `transfer-tokens`: A private helper function that abstracts token transfers, differentiating between native STX transfers and SIP-010 token transfers (specifically sBTC in this implementation).
    *   `is-valid-token`: A private helper to validate if a given token contract is either STX or the supported sBTC token.
*   **P2P Payment Functions:** Implements a claim-based P2P payment system designed to prevent "sent to wrong person" issues:
    *   `send-payment`: Allows sending tokens directly to a wallet, locking them in the contract until claimed by the recipient.
    *   `send-payment-by-phone`: Enables sending payments using a recipient's phone hash, which is resolved via the registry contract before initiating a claim-based payment.
    *   `claim-payment`: Allows the designated recipient to claim a pending payment, transferring tokens from the contract to their wallet.
    *   `refund-payment`: Permits the sender to refund a pending payment if it has not yet been claimed by the recipient.
*   **Group Split Functionality:** The log shows the beginning of the `create-split` function, which validates the total amount, participant count, and token contract before creating a group split.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modularity:** The contract is structured with clear sections for constants, data variables, data maps, and different payment functionalities (P2P, Group Split, Escrow, Pending Payments).
*   **Error Handling:** Consistent use of `asserts!` with specific `ERR_` codes for validation and error reporting.
*   **Nonce Management:** Each major payment type (P2P, Group Split, Escrow, Pending Payments) utilizes a dedicated `*-id-nonce` variable to generate unique identifiers.
*   **Token Agnosticism (STX/sBTC):** The `transfer-tokens` and `is-valid-token` functions demonstrate a design pattern to support both native STX and a specific SIP-010 fungible token.
*   **Privacy through Phone Hashes:** A recurring theme is the integration with a registry contract to enable payments using privacy-preserving phone hashes, abstracting away direct wallet addresses for initial transfers.
*   **Claim-Based Payments:** The P2P module emphasizes a claim-based mechanism, where tokens are held by the contract until the recipient explicitly claims them, allowing the sender to refund if necessary.

## 00:42:38
The provided log details a series of changes primarily focused on integrating Wagmi and RainbowKit for wallet connectivity within the frontend of the "Shadow Protocol" application, specifically targeting the "Somnia Testnet."

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/frontend/src/pages/Auth/Login.tsx`**:
    *   Initially (at 06:16:09), this file contained a React component for user login supporting both email/password and Web3 wallet connection. It utilized custom utility functions like `selectProviderAndRequestAccounts`, `ensureChain`, `detectInjectedProviders`, and `requestAccounts` from `../../utils/wallet`, along with a `WalletPicker` component.
    *   A significant change occurred at 06:21:54, where the imports were updated. The custom wallet utility imports (`selectProviderAndRequestAccounts`, `detectInjectedProviders`, `requestAccounts`) and the `WalletPicker` component import were removed. New imports from Wagmi (`useAccount`, `useSignMessage`, `useNetwork`, `useSwitchNetwork`) and RainbowKit (`ConnectButton`) were added, signaling a migration towards these libraries for wallet interaction. A new state variable `signingIn` was also introduced. It's noteworthy that despite the import changes, the provided code blocks for 06:21:54, 06:22:01, and 06:22:06 still contained the deprecated `handleWalletConnect` logic, `WalletPicker` component, and related states (`showWalletPicker`, `pickerProviders`), suggesting an incomplete transition or a log inconsistency where the component's internal logic hadn't yet been fully refactored to use the new Wagmi/RainbowKit components. The core email/password login functionality remained consistent across these entries.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/frontend/src/wallet/wagmi.ts`**:
    *   This file was introduced at 06:19:08. It defines the configuration for Wagmi and RainbowKit.
    *   It explicitly defines `somniaChain` as a custom chain with `id: 50312`, `name: 'Somnia Testnet'`, its native currency 'Somnia' (SOM), RPC URLs pointing to `https://dream-rpc.somnia.network/`, and a block explorer.
    *   It uses `configureChains` with `somniaChain` and `jsonRpcProvider`.
    *   It integrates `getDefaultWallets` from `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit`, setting the application name to 'Shadow Protocol'.
    *   It exports the `wagmiConfig` (with `autoConnect: true`) and the configured `chains`. The content remained consistent across its entries (06:19:08 and 06:19:24).

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/frontend/src/main.tsx`**:
    *   At 06:22:17, this file was significantly updated to wrap the main `App` component with `WagmiConfig` and `RainbowKitProvider`, integrating the blockchain configuration globally. It imported `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit/styles.css` and the `wagmiConfig`, `chains` from the newly created `./wallet/wagmi` file.
    *   Subsequent changes addressed TypeScript typing issues with `RainbowKitProvider`. At 06:35:07, a `@ts-ignore` comment was added to bypass a type error related to the `chains` prop.
    *   Finally, at 06:47:10, this workaround was refined by explicitly casting `RainbowKitProvider` to `any` before use (`const AnyRainbowKitProvider = RainbowKitProvider as unknown as any`).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **21/10/2025, 06:16:09**: Initial version of `Login.tsx` focusing on custom wallet connection.
*   **21/10/2025, 06:19:08**: Creation of `wagmi.ts` to define Somnia Testnet and configure Wagmi/RainbowKit.
*   **21/10/2025, 06:21:54**: Initiation of the migration of `Login.tsx` towards Wagmi/RainbowKit by updating imports.
*   **21/10/2025, 06:22:17**: Integration of `WagmiConfig` and `RainbowKitProvider` into `main.tsx` for global blockchain context.
*   **21/10/2025, 06:35:07** and **06:47:10**: Refinements to TypeScript workarounds in `main.tsx` for `RainbowKitProvider`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Migration to Wagmi/RainbowKit**: A clear pattern emerges showing a shift from custom Web3 wallet connection logic to a more robust, standardized solution provided by Wagmi and RainbowKit. This is evident in the new `wagmi.ts` file, the global provider setup in `main.tsx`, and the import changes in `Login.tsx`.
*   **Somnia Testnet Focus**: The configuration consistently targets the "Somnia Testnet" with specific RPC URLs and block explorers.
*   **Authentication Flow**: The `Login.tsx` component plays a central role, handling both traditional email/password authentication and the evolving wallet-based sign-in.
*   **TypeScript Adjustments**: Minor, iterative changes in `main.tsx` indicate efforts to manage TypeScript type compatibility during the integration of `RainbowKitProvider`.
*   **Redundant Log Entries**: Several consecutive log entries for the same file path and content (e.g., `Login.tsx` between 06:17:25 and 06:17:35, and `main.tsx` between 06:22:43 and 06:23:03) suggest minor saves or automatic logging without actual code modifications.

## 01:24:28
The provided log entries all pertain to a single file: `/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/whatspay-stacks/contracts/contracts/whats-pay-unified.clar`.

The content of this file is identical across all recorded timestamps, which are 21/10/2025, 20:23:22; 21/10/2025, 20:23:36; 21/10/2025, 20:24:06; and 22/10/2025, 00:03:14. This suggests a period where the contract code remained stable, or was repeatedly saved without functional modifications.

The `whats-pay-unified.clar` contract outlines a comprehensive payment system on the Stacks blockchain, designed to handle various transaction types with support for phone hash lookups and multiple tokens (STX and sBTC).

Key information about the contract includes:
*   **Purpose**: A "WhatsPay Unified Payments Contract" intended for P2P, Group Split, Escrow, and Pending Payments. It emphasizes phone hash support for all payment types and supports both STX and SIP-010 sBTC tokens.
*   **SIP-010 Integration**: Defines the `sip-010-trait` for token transfers, indicating compliance with the Stacks fungible token standard.
*   **Constants**: Includes `CONTRACT_OWNER`, definitions for STX and an sBTC contract address (on a testnet, `ST1F7QA2MDF17S807EPA36TSS8AMEFY4KA9TVGWXT.sbtc-token`). A comprehensive set of error codes (`ERR_UNAUTHORIZED`, `ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT`, `ERR_PHONE_NOT_REGISTERED`, etc.) and status codes (`STATUS_PENDING`, `STATUS_COMPLETED`, `STATUS_CANCELLED`, `STATUS_REFUNDED`) are defined. Timeouts for pending and escrow payments are also set.
*   **Data Management**: Utilizes data variables for managing unique identifiers (nonces) for various payment types (P2P, Group Split, Escrow, Pending Payments) and a mutable `registry-contract` address.
*   **Data Maps**: Employs several data maps to store transaction details:
    *   `payment-history`: Records general payment information for tracking.
    *   `group-splits`: Stores data related to group payment splits.
    *   `escrows`: Manages escrow agreements, including buyer, seller, amount, status, and description.
    *   `pending-payments`: Handles payments to unregistered recipients using phone hashes.
    *   `p2p-payments`: Specifically for claim-based P2P transactions.
*   **Registry Integration**: Includes public and private functions (`set-registry-contract`, `resolve-phone-hash`) to integrate with a `whats-pay-registry-v5` contract for resolving phone hashes to wallet addresses.
*   **Token Transfer Helpers**: Private functions (`transfer-tokens`, `is-valid-token`) abstract the logic for transferring STX or sBTC and validating token contracts.
*   **P2P Payments**: Implements a "claim-based" P2P payment system, where payments must be claimed by the recipient. This design allows senders to refund payments before they are claimed and prevents "sent to wrong person" issues post-claim. Public functions `send-payment` (by wallet), `send-payment-by-phone` (by hash), `claim-payment`, and `refund-payment` are defined.
*   **Group Split**: The contract starts the definition of group split functionality with `create-split`, allowing a creator to initiate a split payment among multiple participants.

The recurring pattern is the sustained presence of this comprehensive contract structure across all logged timestamps, indicating that the core functionality for a unified payment system, P2P transactions, registry integration, and the initial framework for group splits and escrows was established by the earliest timestamp and remained consistent throughout the log.
