The `whats-pay-unified.clar` contract is a core component of a WhatsPay unified payments system designed for the Stacks blockchain.

**Key File-Specific Information:**

*   **Purpose:** The contract implements a complete payment system supporting P2P, Group Split, Escrow, and Pending Payments. A central feature is its support for making all payments using phone hashes, and it handles both STX and sBTC tokens (specifically 'ST1F7QA2MDF17S807EPA36TSS8AMEFY4KA9TVGWXT.sbtc-token' on a testnet).
*   **Token Trait:** It defines the `sip-010-trait` for standard fungible token operations.
*   **Constants:** Includes definitions for the `CONTRACT_OWNER`, `STX_TOKEN`, `SBTC_CONTRACT`, a comprehensive list of error codes (e.g., `ERR_UNAUTHORIZED`, `ERR_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`, `ERR_PHONE_NOT_REGISTERED`), and status codes (`STATUS_PENDING`, `STATUS_COMPLETED`, `STATUS_CANCELLED`, `STATUS_REFUNDED`). It also sets timeouts for pending and escrow payments (e.g., `PENDING_TIMEOUT` for 24 hours, `ESCROW_TIMEOUT` for 7 days).
*   **Data Variables:** Manages nonces for various payment types (`payment-id-nonce`, `group-split-id-nonce`, `escrow-id-nonce`, `pending-payment-id-nonce`) and holds the address of the `registry-contract` for phone hash lookups.
*   **Data Maps:** Several maps are used to store payment-related data:
    *   `payment-history`: Records general payment details for tracking.
    *   `p2p-payments`: Specifically for claim-based P2P payments, tracking sender, recipient, amount, status, timestamps, and memo.
    *   `group-splits`: Stores details for group payment splits, including creator, total/per-person amounts, participants, contributions, and status.
    *   `escrows`: Manages escrow agreements, storing buyer, seller, amount, status, timestamps, and description.
    *   `pending-payments`: Handles payments to unregistered recipients via phone hashes, allowing them to be claimed later.
*   **Registry Integration:**
    *   `set-registry-contract`: A public function, restricted to the contract owner, to set the address of the registry contract responsible for resolving phone hashes.
    *   `resolve-phone-hash`: A private helper function that dynamically calls the configured `whats-pay-registry-v5` contract to retrieve a wallet address from a phone hash.
*   **Token Transfer Logic:**
    *   `transfer-tokens`: A private helper function that abstracts token transfers, differentiating between native STX transfers and SIP-010 token transfers (specifically sBTC in this implementation).
    *   `is-valid-token`: A private helper to validate if a given token contract is either STX or the supported sBTC token.
*   **P2P Payment Functions:** Implements a claim-based P2P payment system designed to prevent "sent to wrong person" issues:
    *   `send-payment`: Allows sending tokens directly to a wallet, locking them in the contract until claimed by the recipient.
    *   `send-payment-by-phone`: Enables sending payments using a recipient's phone hash, which is resolved via the registry contract before initiating a claim-based payment.
    *   `claim-payment`: Allows the designated recipient to claim a pending payment, transferring tokens from the contract to their wallet.
    *   `refund-payment`: Permits the sender to refund a pending payment if it has not yet been claimed by the recipient.
*   **Group Split Functionality:** The log shows the beginning of the `create-split` function, which validates the total amount, participant count, and token contract before creating a group split.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Modularity:** The contract is structured with clear sections for constants, data variables, data maps, and different payment functionalities (P2P, Group Split, Escrow, Pending Payments).
*   **Error Handling:** Consistent use of `asserts!` with specific `ERR_` codes for validation and error reporting.
*   **Nonce Management:** Each major payment type (P2P, Group Split, Escrow, Pending Payments) utilizes a dedicated `*-id-nonce` variable to generate unique identifiers.
*   **Token Agnosticism (STX/sBTC):** The `transfer-tokens` and `is-valid-token` functions demonstrate a design pattern to support both native STX and a specific SIP-010 fungible token.
*   **Privacy through Phone Hashes:** A recurring theme is the integration with a registry contract to enable payments using privacy-preserving phone hashes, abstracting away direct wallet addresses for initial transfers.
*   **Claim-Based Payments:** The P2P module emphasizes a claim-based mechanism, where tokens are held by the contract until the recipient explicitly claims them, allowing the sender to refund if necessary.
