# Activity Summary for 20/10/2025

## 01:34:23
The log details recent development on a blockchain-related application, primarily focusing on frontend components for managing ground stations and satellites.

### File-Specific Updates:

#### `/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/components/node-form.tsx`
This component facilitates the registration of ground stations.
*   **19/10/2025, 20:04:48**: The initial significant version of the `NodeForm` was logged. It includes a comprehensive form for entering ground station details (name, location, hardware specs, uptime, IPFS CID), integrates with `AppDataContext` for local node registration, and `WalletContext` for connecting a wallet and checking preferred blockchain network.
*   **19/10/2025, 20:05:15**: A key update was made to improve user experience and accessibility. The `onSubmit` function was modified to clear the `stationName` and `ipfsCID` input fields after a successful node registration. Additionally, `role="form" aria-label="Register ground station"` was added to the `<form>` tag, and `htmlFor`/`id` attributes were added to several input labels and fields (`stationName`, `lat`, `specs`, `ipfs`) to enhance accessibility.
*   Subsequent entries for this file (from **19/10/2025, 20:05:31** to **19/10/2025, 20:18:56**) show no further functional or structural changes to the code, indicating minor saves or reformatting.

#### `/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/components/cesium-globe.tsx`
This file defines a React component for visualizing entities on a 3D globe.
*   **19/10/2025, 20:20:51**: This entry represents the introduction or last major update of the `CesiumGlobe` component. It dynamically loads CesiumJS and `satellite.js` from CDNs. The component is highly configurable, supporting various `globeOptions` like base color, lighting, terrain, imagery providers (Cesium World Imagery/Terrain with Ion token, or OpenStreetMap), initial camera view, and visualization toggles for orbit paths, ground tracks, and node coverage. It also integrates with the `AppDataContext` to manage visible nodes and satellites.

#### `/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/app/node-operator/dashboard/page.tsx`
This page serves as a dashboard for ground station operators.
*   **19/10/2025, 20:22:52**: The page initially displayed a `CesiumGlobe`, a list of the operator's ground stations, and placeholders for booking and notification management. It utilized `AppDataContext` and `WalletContext`.
*   **20/10/2025, 00:40:49**: A significant refactoring occurred to simplify the dashboard. The following changes were implemented:
    *   Removed `isOnPreferredChain`, `preferredChainId`, and `switchToPreferredChain` from `useWallet` destructuring, suggesting a relocation or removal of specific chain-related logic from this component.
    *   Deleted several unused `lucide-react` icon imports.
    *   Removed unused state (`notifications`, `profile`) and derived data (`bookings`, `myBookings`, `totalNodes`, `activeNodes`, `totalBookings`, `confirmedBookings`, `pendingBookings`) from the component, streamlining its focus.
    *   Adjusted UI styling (`h1` font-weight, `mb-4` to `mb-6`, removed `bg-slate-800/5` from a div).
    *   Explicitly set the `dataMode="nodes"` prop for the `CesiumGlobe` component, ensuring only ground stations are displayed on the globe in this dashboard.
*   Subsequent entries for this file (from **20/10/2025, 00:41:04** to **20/10/2025, 00:44:24**) are largely duplicates or fragmented logs of the state after the 00:40:49 changes, implying no new functional modifications.

#### `/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/app/satellite-operator/page.tsx`
This page is dedicated to satellite operators.
*   **20/10/2025, 00:45:10**: This is the sole entry for this file, indicating its introduction. It defines the `SatelliteOperatorPage` which renders a title, a descriptive paragraph, and the `SatelliteForm` component.

#### `/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/components/satellite-form.tsx`
This component allows users to register satellites.
*   **20/10/2025, 00:46:46**: The `SatelliteForm` component was introduced. It provides input fields for satellite name, country, NORAD ID, launch date, operational status, two-line element (TLE) orbital data, downlink frequency, data rate, contact email, and an optional IPFS CID. It includes client-side TLE validation, wallet connection checks, and a "Use Example" button to pre-fill TLE data for the International Space Station (ISS). Similar to `NodeForm`, it handles local satellite registration for demo purposes.
*   All subsequent timestamps for this file (from **20/10/2025, 00:51:23** to **20/10/2025, 01:33:35**) contain identical code, suggesting frequent saves without any new functional changes.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:
*   **Development Timeline**: Most changes occurred on October 19th and 20th, 2025, suggesting active development or a concentrated sprint during this period.
*   **Frontend Focus**: All changes are related to React/Next.js frontend components (`.tsx` files), indicating work on the user interface and client-side logic.
*   **Blockchain Integration**: Components consistently import and use `useWallet` and `useAppData` contexts, signifying interactions with a wallet and a centralized application data store. The `MARKETPLACE_ABI` constants in both form components suggest future or current interaction with smart contracts for staking and registration on a blockchain, specifically mentioning the "Creditcoin network".
*   **Demo/UI-Only Functionality**: A recurring pattern is the explicit mention of "UI-only" or "locally registered" entities, implying that the current implementation focuses on frontend presentation and local state management for demonstration purposes, with hooks for eventual blockchain integration.
*   **Accessibility Improvements**: The addition of `role`, `aria-label`, `htmlFor`, and `id` attributes in `node-form.tsx` highlights a focus on enhancing the application's accessibility.
*   **CesiumJS for Visualization**: The `CesiumGlobe` component and its integration into the node operator dashboard demonstrate a robust 3D geospatial visualization capability for ground stations and satellites.
*   **Redundant Log Entries**: Many files exhibit multiple sequential timestamps with identical code content, which could be due to automatic saving, minor non-functional edits not captured in the log, or the way the logging mechanism operates. This is particularly noticeable for `node-form.tsx` and `satellite-form.tsx` after their initial functional updates.
*   **Simplification Trend**: The `node-operator/dashboard/page.tsx` saw a significant cleanup, removing unused imports, state, and complex logic, indicating a move towards a more focused and streamlined dashboard view.

## 02:33:56
The log details changes across two primary files: `/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/components/satellite-form.tsx` and `/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/app/satellite-operator/dashboard/page.tsx`, and also mentions updates to the `.env.local` file, although its content is omitted from the summary due to containing sensitive information.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/components/satellite-form.tsx`**:
    *   **Timestamps:** This file saw continuous activity between 01:34:42 and 01:46:07 on 20/10/2025.
    *   **Content:** No substantial changes were recorded in the provided snippets for this file. Each entry shows the same form structure, state variables (for name, country, NORAD ID, TLE lines, launch date, operation status, downlink frequency, data rate, contact, IPFS CID, loading state, and messages), TLE validation logic (`quickValidateTLE`), and the `onSubmit` function. The form UI, including labels, input fields, text areas, and buttons (Register Satellite, Connect Wallet, Switch to Creditcoin, Use Example), remained identical across all entries. This suggests either very minor, unlogged edits, or a series of saves without functional changes during a development session.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/app/satellite-operator/dashboard/page.tsx`**:
    *   **Timestamps:** This file was modified between 01:51:09 and 02:05:18 on 20/10/2025.
    *   **Content:**
        *   **Initial Change (01:51:09):** The component displays a satellite dashboard with a Cesium globe for visualization and a table for satellite details. It uses `AppDataContext` for satellite data and `WalletContext` for wallet connectivity.
        *   **Margin Adjustment (01:56:31):** The `marginLeft` style property for the main content `div` was changed from `80` to `224`. This is a UI/layout adjustment, likely to accommodate a wider sidebar or navigation element.
        *   **Type Coercion for Table Data (01:56:31):** Within the `satellites.map` function, explicit type assertions `(s as any).downlinkMHz` and `(s as any).costPerMB` were added for `freq` and `cost` variables. Additionally, the rendering logic for `cost` was improved to handle cases where `cost` might not be a number, ensuring `toFixed(2)` is only called on numbers, otherwise displaying 'â€”'. This suggests a refinement in data handling for display robustness.
        *   **Subsequent changes (01:56:37 to 02:05:18):** No further functional or significant structural changes were introduced in this file after the margin and type handling adjustments. These timestamps likely represent minor saves or reformatting.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/components/operator-sidebar.tsx`**:
    *   **Timestamps:** This file was actively changed between 02:19:33 and 02:25:59 on 20/10/2025.
    *   **Content:**
        *   **Initial Change (02:19:33):** The sidebar contained navigation links for "Dashboard" (global), "Stations" (node-operator dashboard), "Fleet" (satellite-operator dashboard), "Register station", and "Register satellite".
        *   **Navigation Refinement (02:23:38):** The top-level "Dashboard" link (href "/") and "Stations" link were removed from the `items` array, streamlining the navigation to specific operator dashboards and registration forms.
        *   **Further Simplification (02:23:57):** The navigation was further pruned to only include "Fleet" (satellite-operator dashboard) and "Register satellite" links.
        *   **Reversion/Expansion (02:24:19):** The `items` array was partially reverted to include "Dashboard" (global) and "Stations" (node-operator dashboard) again, alongside the "Fleet" and registration links. This indicates an indecision or exploration of the navigation structure.
        *   **Contextual Navigation Logic (02:25:59):** The most significant change was the introduction of *conditional navigation items* based on the current `pathname`.
            *   If the path starts with `/node-operator`, it shows "Stations" and "Register station".
            *   If the path starts with `/satellite-operator`, it shows "Satellites" and "Register satellite".
            *   Otherwise (default/global view), it shows "Dashboard", "Stations", and "Satellites".
            This change significantly enhances the user experience by providing context-relevant navigation options.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Timestamp Proximity:** Many changes occurred in very short intervals (seconds to minutes), indicating active development sessions, frequent saves, and potentially iterative testing.
*   **Component-Based Development:** The changes are confined to specific React components (`satellite-form.tsx`, `dashboard/page.tsx`, `operator-sidebar.tsx`), reflecting a modular development approach.
*   **Wallet and App Contexts:** Both `/components/satellite-form.tsx` and `/app/satellite-operator/dashboard/page.tsx` heavily rely on `useAppData` and `useWallet` contexts, suggesting a shared state management and blockchain interaction layer across the application.
*   **UI/UX Refinements:** Minor CSS-like adjustments (e.g., `marginLeft` in `dashboard/page.tsx`) and the evolution of the sidebar navigation (`operator-sidebar.tsx`) point to ongoing user interface and experience improvements.
*   **Data Handling Robustness:** The addition of type checking (`typeof cost === 'number'`) in `dashboard/page.tsx` indicates an effort to make the application more robust against unexpected data types.
*   **Blockchain Interaction (implied):** The presence of `MARKETPLACE_ABI` and calls like `addSatellite` or wallet connection/chain switching functions strongly implies this project is a decentralized application (dApp) interacting with a blockchain (likely Creditcoin, based on the `switchToPreferredChain` message).
*   **Environment Variable Usage:** The `marketplaceAddress` prop using `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS` demonstrates the use of environment variables for configuration.

## 03:34:00
The changes log details updates across two main dashboard files in a `spacelink` blockchain application: `/app/node-operator/dashboard/page.tsx` and `/app/satellite-operator/dashboard/page.tsx`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/app/node-operator/dashboard/page.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 20/10/2025, 02:50:37**: The initial state of the node operator dashboard was logged. This page displays a list of ground stations (nodes) in a table, a `CesiumGlobe` for a "globe-first view" with node coverage, and a `BookingsList` component to manage bookings. It integrates `useAppData` for node data and `useWallet` for connection logic.
    *   **Timestamp: 20/10/2025, 02:50:52**: No significant functional or structural changes were recorded at this timestamp; the content remained identical to the previous entry.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/app/satellite-operator/dashboard/page.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 20/10/2025, 02:51:26**: The initial version of the satellite operator dashboard was introduced. Similar to the node dashboard, it features a `CesiumGlobe` (configured for satellites), a table listing satellites with frequency and cost per MB, and a `BookingsList`. This version also includes wallet connectivity checks for `isOnPreferredChain` and offers a "Switch" button if not on the preferred chain.
    *   **Timestamp: 20/10/2025, 02:53:05**: A UI/layout adjustment was implemented. The main content grid's alignment changed from `items-start` to `items-stretch`. Fixed heights (`h-[420px]`) were applied to the left information card and the `CesiumGlobe` wrapper, with the info card's internal content becoming scrollable (`h-full overflow-auto`).
    *   **Timestamp: 20/10/2025, 02:54:39**: The `CesiumGlobe` component was enhanced with additional `globeOptions`. Specifically, it was configured to use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CESIUM_ION_TOKEN` for authentication, and `useWorldImagery` and `useWorldTerrain` were enabled for a richer globe visualization.
    *   **Subsequent Timestamps (20/10/2025, 02:54:48 through 03:32:27)**: No further functional or structural changes were observed in this file across these entries; the code remained consistent with the 02:54:39 update.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **20/10/2025, 02:50:37**: Initial setup of the node operator dashboard.
*   **20/10/2025, 02:51:26**: Initial setup of the satellite operator dashboard.
*   **20/10/2025, 02:53:05**: Significant layout and styling improvements for the satellite dashboard.
*   **20/10/2025, 02:54:39**: Integration of Cesium Ion token and enhanced imagery/terrain for the `CesiumGlobe` in the satellite dashboard.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Dashboard Structure**: Both node and satellite dashboards share a similar React component structure (Next.js pages). They feature a main layout with a fixed left margin (224px), a top section split into an information card and a `CesiumGlobe`, followed by a detailed data table and a `BookingsList` component.
*   **Data Context and Wallet Integration**: Both dashboards consistently use `useAppData` for fetching and updating application-specific data (nodes, satellites, bookings) and `useWallet` for managing wallet connection, address, and chain interaction.
*   **Dynamic Data Filtering**: Node and satellite lists are filtered using `useMemo` to show only items owned by the connected wallet address, or all if no address is connected.
*   **CesiumGlobe Visualization**: Both dashboards prominently feature a `CesiumGlobe` component, with `dataMode` differing (nodes vs. satellites) and the satellite dashboard adding advanced globe options (Ion token, world imagery/terrain).
*   **Booking Management**: A `BookingsList` component is consistently used in both dashboards to display and allow updates (confirm/cancel) to booking statuses, indicating a shared booking management functionality across different operator roles.
*   **Styling**: A consistent dark theme is applied using Tailwind CSS classes, featuring dark backgrounds (`bg-[#232534]`, `bg-[#1f2229]`, `bg-[#0b0b0d]`), subtle borders (`border-[#2b2f3a]`), and light text (`text-slate-100`, `text-slate-200`, `text-slate-300`, `text-slate-400`). Status indicators use color-coded backgrounds (green for active/confirmed, blue for completed, yellow for pending, red for cancelled).
*   **Environment Variable Usage**: The `CesiumGlobe` component in the satellite dashboard retrieves a `ionToken` from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CESIUM_ION_TOKEN`, indicating a practice of managing sensitive keys via environment variables.

## 04:34:22
The provided log details a series of changes primarily focused on the **Node Operator Dashboard** and the **Ground Station Registration** flow within the `spacelink` application, alongside updates to landing page and footer components.

It integrated `AppDataContext` for data and `WalletContext` for blockchain interactions.
    *   **UI Refinements (20/10/2025, 03:40:51, 04:06:29):** The main "Stations" heading size was adjusted from `text-sm` to `text-lg`. A minor styling update changed the "Connect" button's text color from `text-white` to `text-primary-foreground`.
    *   **Significant UX Change (20/10/2025, 03:54:04):** The "Register" button's functionality was transformed from a simple redirection to `/node-operator/dashboard` to a dedicated link (`<a href="/node-operator/register">`) for "Register a new station." The "Connect" wallet button was also repositioned (`ml-auto`).

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/app/node-operator/register/page.tsx`**
    *   **New Page Creation (20/10/2025, 04:08:00):** This file was introduced as a new, dedicated page (`RegisterNodePage`) for ground station registration. It primarily renders the `NodeForm` component.
    *   **Heading Adjustments (20/10/2025, 04:08:41, 04:09:00):** The heading for "Register Ground Station" was progressively reduced in size from `text-lg` to `text-md` and then to `text-sm`, indicating a typography refinement for consistency or hierarchy.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/components/node-form.tsx`**
    *   **New Component Development (20/10/2025, 04:08:25):** The `NodeForm` component was created. This is a crucial addition, centralizing the ground station registration process. It manages various form inputs (station name, ID, latitude, longitude, hardware specs, dish size, polarization, data rate, uptime, IPFS CID). It includes functionality to auto-fill location using browser geolocation and integrates `AppDataContext` to add nodes locally for the demo. Wallet connectivity checks (`useWallet`) are also embedded for authentication and chain switching. The presence of `MARKETPLACE_ABI` suggests future blockchain contract integration, although current `onSubmit` logic is UI-only.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/components/hero.tsx`**
    *   **Initial State (20/10/2025, 04:11:35):** The Hero component served as the main landing section with calls to action for "Browse Marketplace" and "Register Node" (initially linking to `/node-operator`), and a prompt to "register your satellite."
    *   **Brief "Proof Checker" Experiment (20/10/2025, 04:19:43 - 04:19:49):** A "Proof Checker" button was temporarily added to the hero section, then quickly removed, suggesting an evaluation of its placement on the main landing page.
    *   **Navigation Updates (20/10/2025, 04:31:08 - 04:31:17):** The "Register Node" button's destination was updated to point to the new dedicated registration page, `/node-operator/register`. Similarly, the "register your satellite" link was updated to `/satellite-operator/register`, aligning with dedicated registration flows.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/app/node-operator/page.tsx`**
    *   **New Page Introduction (20/10/2025, 04:30:17):** This new page was created to serve as the main entry point for node operators, providing introductory text and embedding the `NodeForm` component.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/components/footer.tsx`**
    *   **New Component Introduction (20/10/2025, 04:32:39):** The Footer component was added, featuring a call-to-action (CTA) section and standard navigation links. It included a scroll-triggered animation.
    *   **CTA Button Functionality Fixes (20/10/2025, 04:32:49 - 04:33:19):** The `Link` wrapping within the "Launch Marketplace" button was corrected to ensure proper clickable area and navigation. The "Register Your Node" button in the CTA was also made functional by adding a `Link` to `/node-operator/register`.

**Significant Changes by Timestamp:**

*   **20/10/2025, 03:54:04:** The "Register" button in the Node Operator Dashboard was transformed into a direct link to a new `/node-operator/register` page, indicating the start of a dedicated registration flow.

*   **20/10/2025, 04:32:39 - 04:33:19:** Introduction of the `Footer` component and subsequent corrections to ensure CTA buttons are properly linked and functional.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Refactoring Towards Dedicated Flows:** A clear pattern emerges of migrating registration functionality from existing pages (like the dashboard or generic operator page) to dedicated, specific registration pages (`/node-operator/register`, hinted `/satellite-operator/register`), improving information architecture and user experience.
*   **UI/UX Iteration:** There are recurring minor adjustments to text sizes (`text-sm`, `text-lg`, `text-md`) and button styling/placement across multiple files, indicating an ongoing process of visual and usability refinement.
*   **Blockchain Integration Readiness:** The consistent use of `useWallet` for connection and chain checks, along with the presence of `MARKETPLACE_ABI` in `NodeForm`, highlights the application's blockchain foundation. The note about "UI-only" local registration suggests a demo or progressive development approach where the UI/logic is built first, followed by full blockchain contract integration.
*   **Frequent Saves/Minor Changes:** Numerous consecutive timestamps show identical code, especially for `/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/app/node-operator/dashboard/page.tsx` and `/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/components/hero.tsx`. This indicates frequent saving during active development, potentially including automatic saves or formatting runs, rather than substantial code modifications in every logged entry.

## 05:34:06
The log details code changes across three files, all dated 20/10/2025.

**File: `/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/components/footer.tsx`**

*   **Timestamp 20/10/2025, 04:37:26:** This timestamp captures the initial state of the `Footer` component. It includes a Call-to-Action (CTA) section with buttons for "Launch Marketplace," "Register Your Node," and "Proof Checker," alongside a main footer area displaying brand information, navigation links (Product, Resources, Company), and copyright details. The component utilizes a `useScrollAnimation` hook for an interactive effect on the CTA section.
*   **Timestamp 20/10/2025, 04:37:46:** A functional update was applied to the "Register Your Node" button within the CTA section. Previously a plain button, it was modified to wrap its text in a Next.js `Link` component, directing users to `/node-operator/register`.
*   **Timestamps 20/10/2025, 04:39:57 through 05:22:23:** Subsequent entries for this file show no discernible code changes, suggesting minor formatting, whitespace adjustments, or repeated saves without functional modifications.

**File: `/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/package.json`**

*   **Timestamp 20/10/2025, 05:23:02 and 05:23:17:** These timestamps reflect the project's dependency configuration. The project is a Next.js application (version 15.5.4) using React (version 19.2.0). Key dependencies include a wide range of Radix UI components, `tailwind-merge` and `tailwindcss-animate` for styling, `ethers` and `@walletconnect/web3-provider` for blockchain integration, and `@react-three/drei`, `@react-three/fiber`, `three`, `leva`, and `r3f-perf` for 3D rendering capabilities. The development dependencies list `@openzeppelin/contracts`, indicating smart contract development. No changes were observed between the two entries for this file.

**File: `/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/components/context/WalletContext.tsx`**

*   **Timestamp 20/10/2025, 05:28:40:** This entry shows a custom implementation of a `WalletContext`. It manages wallet connection state (address, chain ID, errors) and provides functions to `connect` (supporting injected providers like MetaMask and WalletConnect) and `disconnect`. It manually handles `ethereum` event listeners for `accountsChanged` and `chainChanged`. The component also parses environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_CREDITCOIN_*`) to configure a "preferred chain" and includes logic to `switchToPreferredChain` and add new chains if unrecognized.
*   **Timestamp 20/10/2025, 05:28:56:** No discernible code change from the previous entry.
*   **Timestamp 20/10/2025, 05:33:23:** This is a major update, refactoring the `WalletContext` to leverage the `wagmi` library and `@web3modal/react` (Web3Modal v2). The custom wallet connection logic, manual event handling, and direct `window.ethereum` interactions are replaced by `wagmi`'s hooks and `Web3Modal`'s UI. The `connect` function now uses `wagmi`'s `useConnect` hook, prioritizing injected providers via the modal. The "preferred chain" configuration from environment variables is now integrated into `wagmi`'s chain setup, and a `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` is introduced. The `switchToPreferredChain` function becomes a no-op, implying chain switching is handled by the underlying libraries.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   All recorded changes occurred on the same date, 20/10/2025, indicating a concentrated period of development.
*   The project, named "SpaceLink," focuses on "Decentralizing satellite communication through blockchain-powered ground station networks" and was built for the "Moonshot Universe Hackathon 2025."
*   There's a consistent use of Next.js and Tailwind CSS for frontend development.
*   Environment variables are critical for configuring blockchain-related parameters, particularly for the Creditcoin network in `WalletContext.tsx`.
*   A significant pattern is the evolution of blockchain interaction from a custom, low-level implementation to a more abstracted, library-driven approach using `wagmi` and `Web3Modal`, indicating a move towards industry-standard, robust solutions for dApp development.

## 06:34:00
The core of the changes revolves around establishing and integrating Web3 wallet functionality within the `spacelink` application, particularly with a focus on a "Creditcoin" network.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/components/context/WalletContext.tsx (Timestamp: 20/10/2025, 05:34:48)**
    This file introduces a comprehensive `WalletContext` using Wagmi and Web3Modal. It sets up the wallet connection infrastructure, including `useAccount`, `useConnect`, `useDisconnect`, and `useNetwork` hooks. A key feature is the dynamic configuration of a "Creditcoin" chain using environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_CREDITCOIN_CHAIN_ID`, `_RPC_URL`, `_CHAIN_NAME`, `_CHAIN_SYMBOL`). The context provides functions to `connect`, `disconnect`, and `switchToPreferredChain`, along with status indicators like `address`, `chainId`, `isOnPreferredChain`, and `lastError`. It also prioritizes injected wallet connectors (e.g., MetaMask) for connection.

*   **/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/components/floating-nav.tsx (Timestamp: 20/10/2025, 06:19:04)**
    This component implements a floating navigation bar that dynamically adjusts its visibility based on scroll direction. It integrates with the new `useWallet` hook from `WalletContext`. If a wallet is not connected, it displays a "Connect Wallet" button that triggers the `connect()` function. Once connected, it shows a truncated version of the user's wallet address.

*   **/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/spacelink/components/book-modal.tsx (Timestamp: 20/10/2025, 06:22:04 and 20/10/2025, 06:30:36)**
    This modal facilitates booking "Relay Passes" (described as a "UI demo"). It extensively leverages the `useWallet` context to guide the user through the booking process. Before a booking can be confirmed, it checks:
    1.  If a wallet is connected (`address`). If not, it prompts the user to connect.
    2.  If the connected wallet is on the `preferredChainId` (Creditcoin). If not, it displays a "Switch to Creditcoin" button utilizing `switchToPreferredChain`.
    The modal also manages input for satellite selection and booking times (start/end) and simulates a booking process with a brief delay before calling `addBooking`. The two timestamps indicate an initial change and a subsequent save without functional modifications to the code within this log.

**Significant Timestamps:**

*   **20/10/2025, 05:34:48:** Marks the introduction of the foundational `WalletContext`, enabling Web3 interactions.
*   **20/10/2025, 06:19:04:** Shows the first integration of wallet status into a core UI element, the `FloatingNav`.
*   **20/10/2025, 06:22:04:** Highlights the implementation of critical wallet and chain checks for user actions within the `BookModal`, indicating a step towards functional blockchain interaction.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Extensive Wallet Integration:** A prominent pattern is the deep integration of Web3 wallet connectivity (`useWallet` hook) into various parts of the application's UI, from navigation to interactive modals.
*   **Creditcoin Network as Preferred Chain:** The application is explicitly configured to use a "Creditcoin" network, indicated by the detailed environment variable parsing and checks within the `WalletContext` and `BookModal` to ensure the user is on the correct chain.
*   **Environment Variable Dependency:** Configuration for Web3Modal's `projectId` and all Creditcoin network details are fetched from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables, suggesting a flexible setup for different environments or networks.
*   **User-Centric Wallet Prompts:** The UI components actively guide the user with clear messages and buttons to connect their wallet or switch to the correct blockchain network before proceeding with actions.
*   **Simulated Blockchain Interaction:** The `BookModal` explicitly states "UI demo" and "local demo," suggesting that while the wallet and chain checks are in place, the actual booking logic (`addBooking`) might currently be a simulation rather than a direct on-chain transaction.
