### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/automation/ortho/manifest.json`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Consistent throughout 18/10/2025, 02:33:33 - 02:37:18.
    *   **Updates:** No changes were recorded in this file's content across multiple entries. It consistently defines the browser extension with Manifest V3, specifying its name ("OmniVoice Browser Controller", version 1.2), description (voice-controlled with Gemini AI for navigation, tab management, zooming, etc.), and a comprehensive list of permissions including `activeTab`, `tabs`, `scripting`, `storage`, `offscreen`, `microphone`, `bookmarks`, `history`, `tabGroups`, and `windows`. It designates `background.js` as the service worker, `popup.html` as the default popup, and `content.js` for content scripts across all URLs.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/automation/ortho/RESEARCH.md`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 18/10/2025, 02:41:38.
    *   **Updates:** This Markdown file contains "OmnVoice â€” model research notes" outlining strategies for implementing a reliable and cost-effective LLM backend. It explores options like Hugging Face Inference/Providers, locally hosted models (llama.cpp, GPT4All), in-browser WASM solutions, and hosted free-tier endpoints. Key recommendations include:
        1.  Short-term: Using Hugging Face Inference (router) with a personal token.
        2.  Mid-term: Implementing a small server proxy to manage sensitive API keys (e.g., Gemini) to avoid client-side exposure.
        3.  Long-term/Local: Investigating `llama.cpp` or `gpt4all` for offline processing or WASM for tiny in-browser models.
        It also emphasizes security, advising against embedding production API keys in the extension and suggesting explicit user consent for sending page content to remote LLMs.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/automation/ortho/popup.html`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 18/10/2025, 02:41:51.
    *   **Updates:** This HTML file defines the user interface for the extension's popup. It includes fields for configuring model providers (Gemini, Hugging Face, Local), corresponding API keys, model IDs, and local server endpoints. It also features buttons to start/stop voice control, display status messages, and show command history.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/automation/ortho/popup.js`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Significant changes occurred from 18/10/2025, 02:42:22 to 03:17:53.
    *   **Updates:** This JavaScript file, responsible for the popup's interactive logic, saw substantial additions and refinements:
        *   **Initial Setup (02:42:22):** Basic loading and saving of API keys and model settings for Gemini, Hugging Face, and local providers. It set up event listeners for voice control buttons and message listeners to display transcripts and status.
        *   **Prompt Template Management (02:46:11):** A major feature addition introduced UI elements and logic for managing custom prompt templates. Users can now select, create, save, delete, and restore default templates, enhancing the extensibility and configurability of the AI assistant's behavior. The templates are loaded from `chrome.storage.local` or fetched from the background script if not found locally.
        *   **Autonomous Mode Toggle (02:55:56):** An "Autonomous mode" checkbox was added, allowing users to enable or disable autonomous operation, with its state persisted via `chrome.storage.local`.
        *   **Enhanced Status Reporting (03:14:12 - 03:17:53):** The logic for updating `statusElement` and `voiceStatusElement` was significantly improved to provide more detailed feedback on the voice control state, including intermediate statuses during startup/shutdown, and specific messages for various voice recognition and microphone permission events (e.g., 'listening', 'mic_denied', 'recognition_error').

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/automation/ortho/background.js`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Heavy development between 18/10/2025, 02:44:58 and 03:23:32.
    *   **Updates:** This is the core service worker for the extension, managing voice recognition, AI model interaction, and browser actions:
        *   **Initial AI Integration (02:44:58):** Defined default prompt templates and functions to set up an offscreen document for continuous voice recognition. It included a `sendPromptToModel` function supporting local, Hugging Face, and Gemini AI providers with a fallback mechanism.
        *   **Template Defaults Exposure (02:45:04):** Added a new message type (`get_default_templates`) to allow the popup to retrieve default prompt templates, supporting the new template management UI.
        *   **Shift to Gemini-Only Model (03:01:04):** The `sendPromptToModel` function was refactored to *exclusively* use the Gemini API. The multi-provider logic was removed, and an error is thrown if the Gemini API key is missing. The `DEFAULT_PROMPT_TEMPLATES` were significantly expanded and formalized into distinct JSON-outputting instructions for various browser actions (e.g., `search`, `navigate`, `click`, `scroll`, `bookmark`), indicating a more structured approach to AI command processing.
        *   **Robust Microphone Permission Handling (03:08:44 - 03:23:32):** This area saw the most complex evolution:
            *   Introduced a `permissionGrantTabId` to track a helper tab for microphone permission.
            *   Implemented logic to detect `mic_denied` or `recognition_error` messages (if related to permissions) from the offscreen document and open a `permission.html` tab to guide the user.
            *   Refactored message listeners to handle synchronous and asynchronous responses effectively, especially for starting/stopping listening and processing permission results.
            *   Advanced permission management was added, including:
                *   Checking if the permission helper tab is already open and focusing it instead of creating a new one.
                *   Implementing a backoff mechanism (`PERMISSION_BACKOFF_MS = 30s`) to prevent frequent re-opening of the permission prompt.
                *   Limiting auto-opening of the helper tab to `MAX_PERMISSION_ATTEMPTS` (3) after consecutive user denials.
                *   Tracking `permissionPromptShownAt`, `lastPermissionDeniedAt`, `permissionAttemptCount`, and `lastPermissionGrantedAt` to manage permission state.
                *   Added a `chrome.tabs.onRemoved` listener to clear helper state if the user manually closes the permission tab.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/automation/ortho/permission.html`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 18/10/2025, 03:09:05.
    *   **Updates:** This new HTML file was introduced to provide a dedicated, user-facing page for granting microphone access, improving the user experience for permission requests.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/automation/ortho/permission.js`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Consistent throughout 18/10/2025, 03:09:13 - 03:12:46.
    *   **Updates:** This new JavaScript file provides the logic for the `permission.html` page. It listens for a button click, requests microphone access using `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()`, immediately stops the stream (as only permission is needed), updates the UI with the permission status, and sends a `permission_result` message back to the `background.js` script.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Chrome Extension APIs:** Heavy reliance on Chrome extension APIs (`chrome.storage.local`, `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`, `chrome.offscreen`, `chrome.tabs`) for inter-component communication, persistent storage, and background processes.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Code changes show a clear pattern of initial implementation followed by significant enhancements, particularly in `popup.js` (template management) and `background.js` (AI provider simplification, detailed microphone permission handling).
*   **Modularity:** The project structure with distinct files for manifest, research notes, popup UI, background logic, and permission helpers demonstrates a modular design approach.
*   **User Experience Focus:** The additions of template customization, autonomous mode, and a dedicated permission helper tab with sophisticated state management highlight a strong emphasis on user control and a smoother experience, especially around potentially tricky aspects like microphone permissions.
*   **AI-Centric Design:** The "OmniVoice Browser Controller" is fundamentally built around AI, with `RESEARCH.md` detailing model choices and `background.js` directly integrating with LLM providers for command interpretation. The shift in `background.js` to a Gemini-specific implementation and richer prompt templates suggests a commitment to a particular AI strategy.
*   **JSON-Based Communication/Instructions:** Prompt templates in `background.js` consistently instruct the AI to output "ONLY JSON with action details", indicating a structured approach to interpreting natural language commands into actionable browser operations.
