## 00:25:39
The project "wattspay" is undergoing active development, focusing on a blockchain-based payment system integrated with WhatsApp, leveraging Aptos blockchain and WebAuthn for secure wallet management.

**File-Specific Updates and Significant Timestamps:**

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/contracts/payment_coordinator.move`** (Last updated: 27/10/2025, 17:16:18)
    *   This file defines the core smart contract for payment coordination on the Aptos blockchain.
    *   It specifies error codes, payment statuses (e.g., `PENDING`, `COMPLETED`), and types (`DIRECT`, `REQUEST`, `GROUP`).
    *   Key data structures include `Payment`, `PaymentRegistry` (managing global state like next payment ID, total volume, min/max amounts, and expiry), and `PaymentRequest`.
    *   It implements functions for executing direct payments, requesting payments, approving, and rejecting payment requests. These functions handle `AptosCoin` transfers, update transaction statistics for users, manage reputation scores, and emit events for external integration.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/create/page.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (27/10/2025, 04:49:46 - 27/10/2025, 04:50:09):** This page initially allowed users to generate a cryptocurrency seed (private key) locally, with options to copy or download it. This seed, along with other wallet details, was then submitted to a backend `/wallet/create-callback` endpoint. The backend URL was updated to a specific ngrok address.
    *   **Major Refactoring to Passkey-first Onboarding (27/10/2025, 21:34:35 - 27/10/2025, 21:59:11):** A significant architectural shift occurred, replacing direct seed handling with a WebAuthn (Passkey) based wallet creation flow.
        *   The new approach (fully implemented by **27/10/2025, 21:59:11**) now uses `PasskeyUtils` to create a passkey on the user's device.
        *   An Aptos account (private key, public key, address) is generated *locally* on the client-side.
        *   A Key Encryption Key (KEK) is derived from the cryptographic signature provided by the passkey assertion.
        *   The locally generated Aptos private key is then encrypted using AES-GCM with this KEK and stored locally (e.g., in `localStorage`).
        *   Critically, only the *encrypted private key* (ciphertext), public key, and other metadata are sent to the backend, ensuring the raw private key never leaves the user's device.
        *   The UI was updated to guide users through this new passkey-driven onboarding process.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/passkey-utils.ts`** (Significant change at 27/10/2025, 17:21:59)
    *   This file provides a suite of WebAuthn and cryptographic utilities.
    *   It includes functions to check WebAuthn availability, perform Base64 encoding/decoding, create WebAuthn credentials, and obtain authentication assertions.
    *   Core cryptographic functions for HKDF-SHA256 key derivation, AES-GCM encryption/decryption, and specifically deriving a Key Encryption Key (KEK) from a WebAuthn assertion's signature are present.
    *   Basic `localStorage` wrappers are implemented for temporary local storage of encrypted wallet data.
    *   A minor type annotation in `createWebAuthnCredential` was refined on **27/10/2025, 17:21:59** for more specific type assertion.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/sign/page.tsx`** (Last updated: 27/10/2025, 21:43:12)
    *   This page serves as an interface for users to review and approve blockchain payment transactions, likely triggered via a WhatsApp message.
    *   It parses payment details (`payload`) and `waId` from URL parameters.
    *   The `doSignAndSubmit` function currently simulates transaction signing and submission, generating a dummy transaction hash and a simulated delay.
    *   It attempts to send transaction results (including the dummy hash and original payload) to a backend endpoint (`/wallet/tx-callback`).
    *   The UI provides a clear summary of payment details (amount, recipient, description), a signing button, and displays status messages.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/server/webauthnController.ts`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (27/10/2025, 21:53:30):** This Express router manages WebAuthn registration and authentication flows on the backend. It uses `@simplewebauthn/server` to handle credential options and verification. In-memory maps store challenges. It validates registration responses, extracts credential metadata (ID, public key, counter), and persists it in the database (via Prisma) linked to the `whatsappId` of a user. For authentication, it verifies assertions and, if a payment payload is included, executes the payment via `sendPayment`.
    *   **Refinements and Type Workarounds (27/10/2025, 22:11:14 - 27/10/2025, 22:21:24):**
        *   **27/10/2025, 22:11:14**: Challenges are explicitly cast to `String()` for consistent storage and comparison. Crucially, comments were added to reinforce that **no plaintext private key material is stored on the server.**
        *   **27/10/2025, 22:16:00**: A TypeScript type workaround `const db: any = prisma;` was introduced to address potential type inference issues with the Prisma client, facilitating flexible database access. Subsequent commits (e.g., **27/10/2025, 22:21:09**) further applied and refined type annotations with `(c:any)`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Strong Emphasis on WebAuthn and Passkeys:** The most prominent pattern is the adoption of WebAuthn for secure, passwordless authentication and key management, reflecting a modern approach to crypto wallet security.
*   **Client-Side Private Key Encryption:** A recurring security principle is to generate and encrypt private keys solely on the client-side, with the server only receiving and storing the ciphertext. This minimizes the risk of private key exposure.
*   **Aptos Blockchain as Foundation:** The use of `@aptos-labs/ts-sdk` and Aptos Move contracts (`payment_coordinator.move`) demonstrates that Aptos is the chosen blockchain platform for WattsPay.
*   **WhatsApp Integration:** The consistent presence of `waId` parameters and references to WhatsApp indicates that the application is designed to provide blockchain payment services directly through the WhatsApp messaging platform.
*   **UI/UX Design:** The frontend components (Card, Button, Alert) from `@/components/ui` suggest a cohesive and user-friendly interface.
*   **"Demo/Temporary" Designations:** Several code comments indicate that some current implementations (e.g., in-memory challenge storage, `localStorage` for wallets) are for demonstration or temporary use, highlighting plans for more robust, production-ready solutions (like Redis, IndexedDB).
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Both frontend and backend components include comprehensive error handling and status reporting, which is crucial for a financial application.
