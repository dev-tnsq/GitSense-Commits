# Activity Summary for 28/10/2025

## 00:25:39
The project "wattspay" is undergoing active development, focusing on a blockchain-based payment system integrated with WhatsApp, leveraging Aptos blockchain and WebAuthn for secure wallet management.

**File-Specific Updates and Significant Timestamps:**

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/contracts/payment_coordinator.move`** (Last updated: 27/10/2025, 17:16:18)
    *   This file defines the core smart contract for payment coordination on the Aptos blockchain.
    *   It specifies error codes, payment statuses (e.g., `PENDING`, `COMPLETED`), and types (`DIRECT`, `REQUEST`, `GROUP`).
    *   Key data structures include `Payment`, `PaymentRegistry` (managing global state like next payment ID, total volume, min/max amounts, and expiry), and `PaymentRequest`.
    *   It implements functions for executing direct payments, requesting payments, approving, and rejecting payment requests. These functions handle `AptosCoin` transfers, update transaction statistics for users, manage reputation scores, and emit events for external integration.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/create/page.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (27/10/2025, 04:49:46 - 27/10/2025, 04:50:09):** This page initially allowed users to generate a cryptocurrency seed (private key) locally, with options to copy or download it. This seed, along with other wallet details, was then submitted to a backend `/wallet/create-callback` endpoint. The backend URL was updated to a specific ngrok address.
    *   **Major Refactoring to Passkey-first Onboarding (27/10/2025, 21:34:35 - 27/10/2025, 21:59:11):** A significant architectural shift occurred, replacing direct seed handling with a WebAuthn (Passkey) based wallet creation flow.
        *   The new approach (fully implemented by **27/10/2025, 21:59:11**) now uses `PasskeyUtils` to create a passkey on the user's device.
        *   An Aptos account (private key, public key, address) is generated *locally* on the client-side.
        *   A Key Encryption Key (KEK) is derived from the cryptographic signature provided by the passkey assertion.
        *   The locally generated Aptos private key is then encrypted using AES-GCM with this KEK and stored locally (e.g., in `localStorage`).
        *   Critically, only the *encrypted private key* (ciphertext), public key, and other metadata are sent to the backend, ensuring the raw private key never leaves the user's device.
        *   The UI was updated to guide users through this new passkey-driven onboarding process.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/passkey-utils.ts`** (Significant change at 27/10/2025, 17:21:59)
    *   This file provides a suite of WebAuthn and cryptographic utilities.
    *   It includes functions to check WebAuthn availability, perform Base64 encoding/decoding, create WebAuthn credentials, and obtain authentication assertions.
    *   Core cryptographic functions for HKDF-SHA256 key derivation, AES-GCM encryption/decryption, and specifically deriving a Key Encryption Key (KEK) from a WebAuthn assertion's signature are present.
    *   Basic `localStorage` wrappers are implemented for temporary local storage of encrypted wallet data.
    *   A minor type annotation in `createWebAuthnCredential` was refined on **27/10/2025, 17:21:59** for more specific type assertion.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/sign/page.tsx`** (Last updated: 27/10/2025, 21:43:12)
    *   This page serves as an interface for users to review and approve blockchain payment transactions, likely triggered via a WhatsApp message.
    *   It parses payment details (`payload`) and `waId` from URL parameters.
    *   The `doSignAndSubmit` function currently simulates transaction signing and submission, generating a dummy transaction hash and a simulated delay.
    *   It attempts to send transaction results (including the dummy hash and original payload) to a backend endpoint (`/wallet/tx-callback`).
    *   The UI provides a clear summary of payment details (amount, recipient, description), a signing button, and displays status messages.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/server/webauthnController.ts`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (27/10/2025, 21:53:30):** This Express router manages WebAuthn registration and authentication flows on the backend. It uses `@simplewebauthn/server` to handle credential options and verification. In-memory maps store challenges. It validates registration responses, extracts credential metadata (ID, public key, counter), and persists it in the database (via Prisma) linked to the `whatsappId` of a user. For authentication, it verifies assertions and, if a payment payload is included, executes the payment via `sendPayment`.
    *   **Refinements and Type Workarounds (27/10/2025, 22:11:14 - 27/10/2025, 22:21:24):**
        *   **27/10/2025, 22:11:14**: Challenges are explicitly cast to `String()` for consistent storage and comparison. Crucially, comments were added to reinforce that **no plaintext private key material is stored on the server.**
        *   **27/10/2025, 22:16:00**: A TypeScript type workaround `const db: any = prisma;` was introduced to address potential type inference issues with the Prisma client, facilitating flexible database access. Subsequent commits (e.g., **27/10/2025, 22:21:09**) further applied and refined type annotations with `(c:any)`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Strong Emphasis on WebAuthn and Passkeys:** The most prominent pattern is the adoption of WebAuthn for secure, passwordless authentication and key management, reflecting a modern approach to crypto wallet security.
*   **Client-Side Private Key Encryption:** A recurring security principle is to generate and encrypt private keys solely on the client-side, with the server only receiving and storing the ciphertext. This minimizes the risk of private key exposure.
*   **Aptos Blockchain as Foundation:** The use of `@aptos-labs/ts-sdk` and Aptos Move contracts (`payment_coordinator.move`) demonstrates that Aptos is the chosen blockchain platform for WattsPay.
*   **WhatsApp Integration:** The consistent presence of `waId` parameters and references to WhatsApp indicates that the application is designed to provide blockchain payment services directly through the WhatsApp messaging platform.
*   **UI/UX Design:** The frontend components (Card, Button, Alert) from `@/components/ui` suggest a cohesive and user-friendly interface.
*   **"Demo/Temporary" Designations:** Several code comments indicate that some current implementations (e.g., in-memory challenge storage, `localStorage` for wallets) are for demonstration or temporary use, highlighting plans for more robust, production-ready solutions (like Redis, IndexedDB).
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Both frontend and backend components include comprehensive error handling and status reporting, which is crucial for a financial application.

## 01:27:57
The project `wattspay` is actively undergoing development, focusing on integrating Aptos blockchain payments with WhatsApp, leveraging passkeys for enhanced security. Key changes observed across the codebase revolve around wallet creation, payment processing, and WebAuthn integration.

**File-Specific Updates**:

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/create/page.tsx`**: This frontend component underwent a significant transformation on 27/10/2025. Initially designed for traditional seed-phrase based wallet generation and submission to a backend, it was refactored to implement a "Passkey-first onboarding" flow. This new approach generates an Aptos account locally, uses WebAuthn (passkeys) to derive a Key Encryption Key (KEK) from an assertion signature, encrypts the Aptos private key on the client, and then stores this encrypted data locally. The backend is only sent the public key, the encrypted private key (ciphertext), and the encryption IV, ensuring the plaintext private key never leaves the user's device. The UI was adapted to guide users through this passkey-based process.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/contracts/payment_coordinator.move`**: This Aptos Move smart contract, last updated on 27/10/2025, defines the core logic for payment coordination within WattsPay. It establishes constants for error codes, payment statuses (pending, completed, failed, refunded, expired) and types (direct, request, group). Key structs include `Payment` for transaction details, `PaymentRegistry` for global settings and statistics (e.g., min/max amounts, expiry), and `PaymentRequest` for managing payment requests. The module includes functions to initialize the registry, execute direct payments, create and approve/reject payment requests, and retrieve payment details, all while emitting relevant events for off-chain integration.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/passkey-utils.ts`**: This utility file, seeing updates throughout 27/10/2025, provides foundational WebAuthn (Passkey) and cryptographic functions. It includes helpers for feature detection (`isWebAuthnAvailable`), Base64 encoding/decoding, WebAuthn credential creation (`createWebAuthnCredential`) and assertion (`getWebAuthnAssertion`). Crucially, it defines methods for Key Derivation Function (HKDF-SHA256) to derive a KEK from a WebAuthn assertion signature, AES-GCM encryption/decryption, and local storage wrappers for encrypted wallet payloads. Minor type safety enhancements were introduced.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/sign/page.tsx`**: This frontend component, consistently updated on 27/10/2025, is responsible for displaying payment details and initiating the signing process. It parses payment payloads and WhatsApp IDs from URL parameters, presents transaction details (amount, recipient, description), and simulates the signing and submission of an Aptos transaction. In its current form, it uses a randomly generated transaction hash and a delay to mimic the blockchain interaction, along with status updates and security reminders.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/server/webauthnController.ts`**: This backend Express router, with several updates on 27/10/2025, manages the server-side WebAuthn flows. It handles requests for generating registration and authentication options, verifying responses, and securely storing WebAuthn credential metadata (credentialId, publicKey, counter) in the database via Prisma (with a workaround for typing issues). It uses in-memory maps for challenges (with a note for production scalability) and includes logic to execute payments through `paymentService.js` once an assertion is successfully verified. Comments emphasize that plaintext private keys are never stored on the server.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/page.tsx`**: The main landing page for WattsPay, updated on 28/10/2025, features marketing content highlighting its Aptos and WhatsApp integration, including sections for a hero message, a scroll-based narrative ("3D Scroll Story"), key features (Lightning Payments, Squad Bill Splitting, Fort Knox Escrow), and a waitlist signup form. It includes a specific WhatsApp number for demo purposes.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/scripts/send-whatsapp-test.mjs`**: This file was created on 28/10/2025 but remained empty in the provided log, suggesting an intended script for testing WhatsApp messaging.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/bot/twilioClient.ts`**: Updated on 28/10/2025, this module provides functionality to send WhatsApp messages using the Twilio API. It includes robust error handling, specifically catching Twilio error `63007` (invalid WhatsApp sender) to provide a more descriptive message.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/PITCH.md`**: A detailed pitch document created on 28/10/2025, outlining the project's problem, solution (WhatsApp bot with passkey-powered non-custodial wallets), market, business model, competitive advantages, validation plan, demo script, funding ask, and roadmap. It explicitly addresses key security questions regarding private key storage and recovery.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes**:

    *   **Timestamp: 27/10/2025, 17:16:18**: This file was initialized, defining the core logic for the WattsPay payment system on the Aptos blockchain. It introduced structs for `Payment`, `PaymentRegistry`, and `PaymentRequest`, along with various error codes and payment status constants. Key functionalities include `execute_payment` for direct transfers, `request_payment` to initiate payment requests, `approve_payment_request` for fulfilling requests, and `reject_payment_request`. The contract also detailed event emissions for integration with external systems, notably a WhatsApp bot.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/create/page.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps: 27/10/2025, 04:49:46 - 27/10/2025, 04:50:09**: Initially, this React component allowed users to generate an Aptos wallet seed (private key), copy/download it, and submit the wallet details (including a raw private key, then referred to as `encryptedPrivateKey`) to a backend endpoint. A significant early change updated the `backendUrl` to a specific ngrok address (`https://65d7ad535a66.ngrok-free.app`).
    *   **Timestamps: 27/10/2025, 21:34:35 - 27/10/2025, 21:54:50**: This period shows substantial refactoring and some temporary inconsistencies. The component was first replaced with a passkey-focused version, generating a *dummy* private key and encrypting it using WebAuthn. This then led to a state where the file contained *two* `CreateWalletPage` components (a potential merge conflict or experimental phase), along with minor import path adjustments and typo corrections for React hooks.
    *   **Timestamps: 27/10/2025, 21:59:11 - 27/10/2025, 22:06:51**: A major refactor consolidated the component into a single, clean `CreateWalletPage`. This updated version fully integrates passkey (WebAuthn) for wallet creation: it generates an actual Aptos private key locally, uses a WebAuthn assertion to derive a Key Encryption Key (KEK), encrypts the Aptos private key locally, and then sends the *ciphertext* (encrypted private key) along with public key and address to the backend for registration. The UI was updated to reflect this "Passkey-first onboarding" approach, including a security reminder that the server never receives the plaintext private key.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/passkey-utils.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps: 27/10/2025, 17:16:52 - 27/10/2025, 17:21:59**: This new utility file was introduced to encapsulate WebAuthn and cryptographic functionalities. It provides helpers for WebAuthn feature detection, credential creation (`createWebAuthnCredential`), assertion retrieval (`getWebAuthnAssertion`), HKDF key derivation (`deriveKeyFromSecret`), AES-GCM encryption/decryption (`aesGcmEncrypt`, `aesGcmDecrypt`), and local storage wrappers. A minor typing refinement for `attestationObject` was observed.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/sign/page.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps: 27/10/2025, 21:43:12 - 27/10/2025, 21:49:24**: This new React component was added to facilitate the review and signing of payment transactions. It retrieves payment details from URL parameters, displays them to the user, and includes a `doSignAndSubmit` function that simulates transaction signing and submission. Upon completion, it notifies a backend endpoint (`/wallet/tx-callback`) with transaction details. The component also incorporates robust UI for loading, success, and error states, along with security reminders.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/server/webauthnController.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps: 27/10/2025, 21:53:30 - 27/10/2025, 22:11:14**: This Express router was created to handle WebAuthn registration and authentication flows on the backend. It uses `@simplewebauthn/server` to generate and verify challenges, storing challenges temporarily in-memory. It interacts with Prisma to persist WebAuthn credential metadata (ID, public key, counter) to the database, linked to user WhatsApp IDs. Critical comments were added to explicitly state that user private key material is *not* stored on the server.
    *   **Timestamps: 27/10/2025, 22:16:00 - 27/10/2025, 22:21:24**: Further refinements included casting the `prisma` client to `any` for more flexible runtime database access and adding `(c:any)` casts within map functions for `excludeCredentials` and `allowCredentials` to resolve TypeScript typing differences. The controller's `/assertion/verify` endpoint also has logic to execute a payment via `sendPayment` if a `paymentPayload` is present.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/page.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps: 28/10/2025, 00:33:13 - 28/10/2025, 00:33:35**: The main landing page for WattsPay was created, featuring a modern design with `framer-motion` animations. It outlines the project's value proposition ("Pay Anyone, Anywhere Without Leaving WhatsApp"), highlights Aptos integration, and showcases key features like "Lightning Payments," "Squad Bill Splitting," and "Fort Knox Escrow." It also includes a call to action for early access and a waitlist signup.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/scripts/send-whatsapp-test.mjs`**
    *   **Timestamp: 28/10/2025, 01:05:36**: This file was created as an empty placeholder, indicating an intention to add a script for testing WhatsApp message sending.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/bot/twilioClient.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps: 28/10/2025, 01:08:37 - 28/10/2025, 01:09:17**: This client for Twilio was introduced to abstract sending WhatsApp messages. It logs message attempts and includes specific error handling to provide clearer debugging information, particularly for common Twilio API errors like invalid sender numbers.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

The development log highlights a clear strategic direction for WattsPay:
1.  **Passkey-first Security Model**: A strong recurring pattern is the adoption and integration of passkeys (WebAuthn) for wallet creation and transaction authentication. This is evident across frontend components (`create/page.tsx`, `passkey-utils.ts`) and backend services (`webauthnController.ts`), emphasizing non-custodial key management where private keys are generated and encrypted on-device, never stored in plaintext on the server.
2.  **WhatsApp as a Primary User Interface**: The project leverages WhatsApp for conversational UX, deep links to web wallets, and bot integration, aiming to onboard a large user base to Aptos. This is supported by the `twilioClient.ts` for message sending and the `PITCH.md` document outlining the market strategy.
3.  **Aptos Blockchain Integration**: All core payment and wallet functionalities are built around the Aptos blockchain, utilizing its `ts-sdk` on the frontend and Move smart contracts (`payment_coordinator.move`) on-chain.
4.  **Iterative Development and Refinement**: Multiple commits to the same files, especially `create/page.tsx` and `webauthnController.ts`, indicate an iterative development process, with continuous improvements in functionality, typing, and clarity (e.g., extensive comments added to the `webauthnController`).
5.  **Focus on User Experience and Onboarding**: The frontend components are designed to simplify the wallet creation and transaction signing process, aiming for a "zero-seed-phrase" experience. The pitch document further underlines this focus.

## 03:28:02
The recent code changes show a strong focus on integrating passkey (WebAuthn) authentication and Aptos blockchain functionality within a WhatsApp-centric payment application called WattsPay. Key information from these changes highlights the evolution of wallet creation, core smart contract logic, backend WebAuthn handling, and a refined project pitch.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/create/page.tsx`**:
    *   **Initial development (27/10/2025, 04:49:46 - 27/10/2025, 21:34:25)**: Started as a React component for generating and submitting a wallet via a backup seed phrase. It used `@aptos-labs/ts-sdk` to generate accounts and interacted with a backend `/wallet/create-callback` endpoint, initially with an unspecified backend URL. The backend URL was later hardcoded to `https://65d7ad535a66.ngrok-free.app` at `04:50:09`.
    *   **Major refactor to Passkey-first (27/10/2025, 21:34:35)**: The page underwent a complete overhaul, discarding the seed-phrase flow in favor of a passkey-based approach. It now imports `PasskeyUtils` for WebAuthn operations. The initial implementation generated a *dummy* Aptos private key and used passkey assertions to derive a Key Encryption Key (KEK) to encrypt this key, storing it locally.
    *   **Refinement and API Integration (27/10/2025, 21:54:18 - 22:06:51)**: Corrected import paths for `PasskeyUtils` and refined React imports. The `handleCreateWithPasskey` function was updated to use a dynamically configured `API_BASE` for backend calls (from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`), and it now generates a *real* Aptos account locally, encrypts its private key using the KEK derived from the passkey, and sends this ciphertext (along with public key) to the backend.
    *   **Client-side On-chain Registration (28/10/2025, 03:20:32)**: A significant enhancement was added to perform on-chain user registration directly from the frontend after successful backend wallet creation. This involves normalizing the `waId` to a SHA-256 phone hash, building an Aptos transaction for `user_registry::register_user`, signing it locally with the generated private key, and submitting it to the Aptos devnet, ensuring true non-custodial key management and on-chain identity.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/contracts/payment_coordinator.move`**:
    *   **Initial implementation (27/10/2025, 17:16:18)**: This Move smart contract defines the core logic for WattsPay. It includes structs for `Payment` records, a global `PaymentRegistry`, and `PaymentRequest` functionality. It establishes error codes, payment statuses, and types. Key entry functions are `execute_payment` (direct transfers), `request_payment`, `approve_payment_request`, and `reject_payment_request`. It also specifies various view functions like `get_payment` to query payment details. The contract is designed to update user transaction statistics and reputation scores via `user_registry` calls.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/passkey-utils.ts`**:
    *   **Initial implementation (27/10/2025, 17:16:52)**: This utility file provides essential WebAuthn and cryptographic functions. It checks WebAuthn availability, converts between `ArrayBuffer` and Base64, wraps `navigator.credentials.create` for passkey registration and `navigator.credentials.get` for assertions. It implements HKDF-SHA256 for KEK derivation, AES-GCM for encryption/decryption, and helpers for deriving KEK from assertion signatures. Basic local storage functions are included for wallet payload saving.
    *   **Minor type refinement (27/10/2025, 17:21:59)**: A type cast for `attestationObject` was added, indicating minor code quality improvements.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/sign/page.tsx`**:
    *   **Initial implementation (27/10/2025, 21:43:12)**: This React page is for reviewing and signing payments. It parses payment payloads and `waId` from URL parameters. The `doSignAndSubmit` function simulates a transaction signing process (generating a dummy hash and adding a delay), then notifies a backend callback endpoint `/wallet/tx-callback`. The UI provides payment details, a signing button, and status feedback.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/server/webauthnController.ts`**:
    *   **Initial implementation (27/10/2025, 21:53:30)**: An Express router handles backend WebAuthn flows. It uses `@simplewebauthn/server` to generate and verify registration/authentication options. In-memory maps store challenges for verification. It persists WebAuthn credential metadata (credentialId, publicKey, counter) to a Prisma database. Crucially, after successful authentication, it can execute payments via `sendPayment` if a `paymentPayload` is provided, reinforcing the server's role in relayed, authorized payments. Explicit comments state that private keys are *not* stored on the server.
    *   **Refinement and Type Handling (27/10/2025, 22:11:14 - 22:21:24)**: Added comments clarifying challenge storage and non-storage of private keys. Introduced a `db: any = prisma` workaround for Prisma client typing issues and applied `any` type annotations to map and find functions to resolve TypeScript errors, ensuring runtime functionality without strict type conflicts during development.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/page.tsx`**:
    *   **Initial implementation (28/10/2025, 00:33:13)**: This is the main landing page for WattsPay, featuring a hero section promoting Aptos-powered WhatsApp payments. It highlights core features (payments, bill splitting, escrow), includes a call to action for the Aptos Devnet via a WhatsApp number, and utilizes `framer-motion` for animations. A waitlist signup form is also present.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/scripts/send-whatsapp-test.mjs`**:
    *   **Empty file (28/10/2025, 01:05:36)**: This file was created but remains empty, indicating it might be a placeholder or was cleared.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/bot/twilioClient.ts`**:
    *   **Initial implementation (28/10/2025, 01:08:37)**: Implements Twilio API integration for sending WhatsApp messages, handling `from`, `to`, `body`, and optional `mediaUrl`. It includes robust error logging and a specific error message for Twilio's `63007` code, guiding developers on correct WhatsApp sender configuration.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/PITCH.md`**:
    *   **Creation and refinement (28/10/2025, 01:15:31 - 01:49:57)**: A detailed pitch document was created and subsequently refined. It outlines WattsPay's value proposition: social payments with passkey-secured, non-custodial Aptos wallets within chat platforms like WhatsApp. It covers the problem, solution, market, business model, competitive advantages (UX, security, simplicity), traction plan, go-to-market strategy, demo script, funding ask, roadmap, and FAQs. Specific details on non-custodial key handling using HKDF + AES-GCM are highlighted.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/test-p2p-payment.js`**:
    *   **Initial implementation (28/10/2025, 02:54:53)**: A test script for P2P payments demonstrating end-to-end flow: creating and funding Aptos accounts, on-chain user registration via generated phone numbers, and executing a payment using `WattsPayService`. It provides detailed output including balances and transaction links.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/WattsPayService.js`**:
    *   **Initial implementation (28/10/2025, 02:59:49)**: This comprehensive JavaScript service acts as an interface to Aptos blockchain and WattsPay smart contracts. It provides methods for basic account operations (create, fund, balance), user registry interactions (register, get by phone, profile, check existence), payment coordination (send by phone, request, approve request, get payment/user payments, platform fee, refund), and group treasury functions (create group, add member/expense, execute settlement, get group/user groups/balances). It uses a hardcoded contract address and targets the Aptos Devnet.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/scripts/seed-phone-wallet.ts`**:
    *   **Initial implementation (28/10/2025, 03:00:56)**: A utility script to seed a test user with an Aptos wallet linked to a pseudo-random phone number. It creates and funds an Aptos account, registers the phone on-chain, and stores the *encrypted* private key (ciphertext, IV, auth tag) in the local database, adhering to the non-custodial security model.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **27/10/2025, ~04:50:00**: Initial wallet creation page development and early backend URL configuration.
*   **27/10/2025, ~17:16:00**: Core smart contract (`payment_coordinator.move`) and WebAuthn utility (`passkey-utils.ts`) implementations are introduced, laying the foundation for the blockchain and secure authentication aspects.
*   **27/10/2025, ~21:34:00**: Major architectural shift in frontend wallet creation (`create/page.tsx`) to a passkey-first approach, removing traditional seed phrase handling. Simultaneously, the backend `webauthnController.ts` is implemented to support this new flow, including server-side payment execution after WebAuthn assertion.
*   **28/10/2025, ~00:33:00**: The marketing-oriented frontend landing page (`page.tsx`) is developed, promoting the WattsPay vision.
*   **28/10/2025, ~01:00:00**: Backend `twilioClient.ts` for WhatsApp messaging is in place. The project pitch (`PITCH.md`) is created and refined, clearly articulating the passkey-first, non-custodial strategy.
*   **28/10/2025, ~02:55:00 - 03:01:00**: `WattsPayService.js` and test/seed scripts (`test-p2p-payment.js`, `seed-phone-wallet.ts`) are introduced, providing robust interaction with the Aptos blockchain and demonstrating end-to-end functionality including secure user/wallet seeding.
*   **28/10/2025, 03:20:32**: Frontend `create/page.tsx` is updated to include client-side on-chain registration, reinforcing the non-custodial nature.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Passkey-first Authentication**: A consistent pattern of prioritizing WebAuthn for secure, user-friendly, non-custodial wallet creation and authentication across frontend, backend, and documentation. Private keys are always encrypted on the client using a KEK derived from passkey assertions, and only ciphertexts are stored on the server.
*   **Aptos Blockchain as Core Technology**: Extensive use of the `@aptos-labs/ts-sdk` and custom Move smart contracts (`payment_coordinator`, implied `user_registry`, `group_treasury`) for all financial transactions and user identity management. The project is explicitly built on Aptos Devnet.
*   **WhatsApp as the Primary User Interface**: The application leverages WhatsApp for conversational UX and deep linking (`waId`), with Twilio facilitating messaging. Frontend pages like `create/page.tsx` and `sign/page.tsx` are designed to be accessed via WhatsApp links.
*   **Non-Custodial Design**: A foundational principle is that the server never holds plaintext private keys, ensuring users maintain full control over their funds. This is implemented through client-side key generation, encryption with passkey-derived keys, and server-side storage of only encrypted data.
*   **Modular Development**: The codebase is structured into distinct modules for frontend UI, blockchain interaction, backend API, and utilities, indicating a well-organized development approach.
*   **Focus on Security and User Experience**: The emphasis on passkeys for security and "zero friction" conversational UX for accessibility is a recurring theme in both code comments and the `PITCH.md`.
