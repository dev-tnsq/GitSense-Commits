# Activity Summary for 28/10/2025

## 00:25:39
The project "wattspay" is undergoing active development, focusing on a blockchain-based payment system integrated with WhatsApp, leveraging Aptos blockchain and WebAuthn for secure wallet management.

**File-Specific Updates and Significant Timestamps:**

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/contracts/payment_coordinator.move`** (Last updated: 27/10/2025, 17:16:18)
    *   This file defines the core smart contract for payment coordination on the Aptos blockchain.
    *   It specifies error codes, payment statuses (e.g., `PENDING`, `COMPLETED`), and types (`DIRECT`, `REQUEST`, `GROUP`).
    *   Key data structures include `Payment`, `PaymentRegistry` (managing global state like next payment ID, total volume, min/max amounts, and expiry), and `PaymentRequest`.
    *   It implements functions for executing direct payments, requesting payments, approving, and rejecting payment requests. These functions handle `AptosCoin` transfers, update transaction statistics for users, manage reputation scores, and emit events for external integration.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/create/page.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (27/10/2025, 04:49:46 - 27/10/2025, 04:50:09):** This page initially allowed users to generate a cryptocurrency seed (private key) locally, with options to copy or download it. This seed, along with other wallet details, was then submitted to a backend `/wallet/create-callback` endpoint. The backend URL was updated to a specific ngrok address.
    *   **Major Refactoring to Passkey-first Onboarding (27/10/2025, 21:34:35 - 27/10/2025, 21:59:11):** A significant architectural shift occurred, replacing direct seed handling with a WebAuthn (Passkey) based wallet creation flow.
        *   The new approach (fully implemented by **27/10/2025, 21:59:11**) now uses `PasskeyUtils` to create a passkey on the user's device.
        *   An Aptos account (private key, public key, address) is generated *locally* on the client-side.
        *   A Key Encryption Key (KEK) is derived from the cryptographic signature provided by the passkey assertion.
        *   The locally generated Aptos private key is then encrypted using AES-GCM with this KEK and stored locally (e.g., in `localStorage`).
        *   Critically, only the *encrypted private key* (ciphertext), public key, and other metadata are sent to the backend, ensuring the raw private key never leaves the user's device.
        *   The UI was updated to guide users through this new passkey-driven onboarding process.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/passkey-utils.ts`** (Significant change at 27/10/2025, 17:21:59)
    *   This file provides a suite of WebAuthn and cryptographic utilities.
    *   It includes functions to check WebAuthn availability, perform Base64 encoding/decoding, create WebAuthn credentials, and obtain authentication assertions.
    *   Core cryptographic functions for HKDF-SHA256 key derivation, AES-GCM encryption/decryption, and specifically deriving a Key Encryption Key (KEK) from a WebAuthn assertion's signature are present.
    *   Basic `localStorage` wrappers are implemented for temporary local storage of encrypted wallet data.
    *   A minor type annotation in `createWebAuthnCredential` was refined on **27/10/2025, 17:21:59** for more specific type assertion.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/sign/page.tsx`** (Last updated: 27/10/2025, 21:43:12)
    *   This page serves as an interface for users to review and approve blockchain payment transactions, likely triggered via a WhatsApp message.
    *   It parses payment details (`payload`) and `waId` from URL parameters.
    *   The `doSignAndSubmit` function currently simulates transaction signing and submission, generating a dummy transaction hash and a simulated delay.
    *   It attempts to send transaction results (including the dummy hash and original payload) to a backend endpoint (`/wallet/tx-callback`).
    *   The UI provides a clear summary of payment details (amount, recipient, description), a signing button, and displays status messages.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/server/webauthnController.ts`**
    *   **Initial Implementation (27/10/2025, 21:53:30):** This Express router manages WebAuthn registration and authentication flows on the backend. It uses `@simplewebauthn/server` to handle credential options and verification. In-memory maps store challenges. It validates registration responses, extracts credential metadata (ID, public key, counter), and persists it in the database (via Prisma) linked to the `whatsappId` of a user. For authentication, it verifies assertions and, if a payment payload is included, executes the payment via `sendPayment`.
    *   **Refinements and Type Workarounds (27/10/2025, 22:11:14 - 27/10/2025, 22:21:24):**
        *   **27/10/2025, 22:11:14**: Challenges are explicitly cast to `String()` for consistent storage and comparison. Crucially, comments were added to reinforce that **no plaintext private key material is stored on the server.**
        *   **27/10/2025, 22:16:00**: A TypeScript type workaround `const db: any = prisma;` was introduced to address potential type inference issues with the Prisma client, facilitating flexible database access. Subsequent commits (e.g., **27/10/2025, 22:21:09**) further applied and refined type annotations with `(c:any)`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Strong Emphasis on WebAuthn and Passkeys:** The most prominent pattern is the adoption of WebAuthn for secure, passwordless authentication and key management, reflecting a modern approach to crypto wallet security.
*   **Client-Side Private Key Encryption:** A recurring security principle is to generate and encrypt private keys solely on the client-side, with the server only receiving and storing the ciphertext. This minimizes the risk of private key exposure.
*   **Aptos Blockchain as Foundation:** The use of `@aptos-labs/ts-sdk` and Aptos Move contracts (`payment_coordinator.move`) demonstrates that Aptos is the chosen blockchain platform for WattsPay.
*   **WhatsApp Integration:** The consistent presence of `waId` parameters and references to WhatsApp indicates that the application is designed to provide blockchain payment services directly through the WhatsApp messaging platform.
*   **UI/UX Design:** The frontend components (Card, Button, Alert) from `@/components/ui` suggest a cohesive and user-friendly interface.
*   **"Demo/Temporary" Designations:** Several code comments indicate that some current implementations (e.g., in-memory challenge storage, `localStorage` for wallets) are for demonstration or temporary use, highlighting plans for more robust, production-ready solutions (like Redis, IndexedDB).
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Both frontend and backend components include comprehensive error handling and status reporting, which is crucial for a financial application.

## 01:27:57
The project `wattspay` is actively undergoing development, focusing on integrating Aptos blockchain payments with WhatsApp, leveraging passkeys for enhanced security. Key changes observed across the codebase revolve around wallet creation, payment processing, and WebAuthn integration.

**File-Specific Updates**:

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/create/page.tsx`**: This frontend component underwent a significant transformation on 27/10/2025. Initially designed for traditional seed-phrase based wallet generation and submission to a backend, it was refactored to implement a "Passkey-first onboarding" flow. This new approach generates an Aptos account locally, uses WebAuthn (passkeys) to derive a Key Encryption Key (KEK) from an assertion signature, encrypts the Aptos private key on the client, and then stores this encrypted data locally. The backend is only sent the public key, the encrypted private key (ciphertext), and the encryption IV, ensuring the plaintext private key never leaves the user's device. The UI was adapted to guide users through this passkey-based process.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/contracts/payment_coordinator.move`**: This Aptos Move smart contract, last updated on 27/10/2025, defines the core logic for payment coordination within WattsPay. It establishes constants for error codes, payment statuses (pending, completed, failed, refunded, expired) and types (direct, request, group). Key structs include `Payment` for transaction details, `PaymentRegistry` for global settings and statistics (e.g., min/max amounts, expiry), and `PaymentRequest` for managing payment requests. The module includes functions to initialize the registry, execute direct payments, create and approve/reject payment requests, and retrieve payment details, all while emitting relevant events for off-chain integration.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/passkey-utils.ts`**: This utility file, seeing updates throughout 27/10/2025, provides foundational WebAuthn (Passkey) and cryptographic functions. It includes helpers for feature detection (`isWebAuthnAvailable`), Base64 encoding/decoding, WebAuthn credential creation (`createWebAuthnCredential`) and assertion (`getWebAuthnAssertion`). Crucially, it defines methods for Key Derivation Function (HKDF-SHA256) to derive a KEK from a WebAuthn assertion signature, AES-GCM encryption/decryption, and local storage wrappers for encrypted wallet payloads. Minor type safety enhancements were introduced.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/sign/page.tsx`**: This frontend component, consistently updated on 27/10/2025, is responsible for displaying payment details and initiating the signing process. It parses payment payloads and WhatsApp IDs from URL parameters, presents transaction details (amount, recipient, description), and simulates the signing and submission of an Aptos transaction. In its current form, it uses a randomly generated transaction hash and a delay to mimic the blockchain interaction, along with status updates and security reminders.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/server/webauthnController.ts`**: This backend Express router, with several updates on 27/10/2025, manages the server-side WebAuthn flows. It handles requests for generating registration and authentication options, verifying responses, and securely storing WebAuthn credential metadata (credentialId, publicKey, counter) in the database via Prisma (with a workaround for typing issues). It uses in-memory maps for challenges (with a note for production scalability) and includes logic to execute payments through `paymentService.js` once an assertion is successfully verified. Comments emphasize that plaintext private keys are never stored on the server.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/page.tsx`**: The main landing page for WattsPay, updated on 28/10/2025, features marketing content highlighting its Aptos and WhatsApp integration, including sections for a hero message, a scroll-based narrative ("3D Scroll Story"), key features (Lightning Payments, Squad Bill Splitting, Fort Knox Escrow), and a waitlist signup form. It includes a specific WhatsApp number for demo purposes.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/scripts/send-whatsapp-test.mjs`**: This file was created on 28/10/2025 but remained empty in the provided log, suggesting an intended script for testing WhatsApp messaging.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/bot/twilioClient.ts`**: Updated on 28/10/2025, this module provides functionality to send WhatsApp messages using the Twilio API. It includes robust error handling, specifically catching Twilio error `63007` (invalid WhatsApp sender) to provide a more descriptive message.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/PITCH.md`**: A detailed pitch document created on 28/10/2025, outlining the project's problem, solution (WhatsApp bot with passkey-powered non-custodial wallets), market, business model, competitive advantages, validation plan, demo script, funding ask, and roadmap. It explicitly addresses key security questions regarding private key storage and recovery.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes**:

    *   **Timestamp: 27/10/2025, 17:16:18**: This file was initialized, defining the core logic for the WattsPay payment system on the Aptos blockchain. It introduced structs for `Payment`, `PaymentRegistry`, and `PaymentRequest`, along with various error codes and payment status constants. Key functionalities include `execute_payment` for direct transfers, `request_payment` to initiate payment requests, `approve_payment_request` for fulfilling requests, and `reject_payment_request`. The contract also detailed event emissions for integration with external systems, notably a WhatsApp bot.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/create/page.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps: 27/10/2025, 04:49:46 - 27/10/2025, 04:50:09**: Initially, this React component allowed users to generate an Aptos wallet seed (private key), copy/download it, and submit the wallet details (including a raw private key, then referred to as `encryptedPrivateKey`) to a backend endpoint. A significant early change updated the `backendUrl` to a specific ngrok address (`https://65d7ad535a66.ngrok-free.app`).
    *   **Timestamps: 27/10/2025, 21:34:35 - 27/10/2025, 21:54:50**: This period shows substantial refactoring and some temporary inconsistencies. The component was first replaced with a passkey-focused version, generating a *dummy* private key and encrypting it using WebAuthn. This then led to a state where the file contained *two* `CreateWalletPage` components (a potential merge conflict or experimental phase), along with minor import path adjustments and typo corrections for React hooks.
    *   **Timestamps: 27/10/2025, 21:59:11 - 27/10/2025, 22:06:51**: A major refactor consolidated the component into a single, clean `CreateWalletPage`. This updated version fully integrates passkey (WebAuthn) for wallet creation: it generates an actual Aptos private key locally, uses a WebAuthn assertion to derive a Key Encryption Key (KEK), encrypts the Aptos private key locally, and then sends the *ciphertext* (encrypted private key) along with public key and address to the backend for registration. The UI was updated to reflect this "Passkey-first onboarding" approach, including a security reminder that the server never receives the plaintext private key.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/passkey-utils.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps: 27/10/2025, 17:16:52 - 27/10/2025, 17:21:59**: This new utility file was introduced to encapsulate WebAuthn and cryptographic functionalities. It provides helpers for WebAuthn feature detection, credential creation (`createWebAuthnCredential`), assertion retrieval (`getWebAuthnAssertion`), HKDF key derivation (`deriveKeyFromSecret`), AES-GCM encryption/decryption (`aesGcmEncrypt`, `aesGcmDecrypt`), and local storage wrappers. A minor typing refinement for `attestationObject` was observed.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/sign/page.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps: 27/10/2025, 21:43:12 - 27/10/2025, 21:49:24**: This new React component was added to facilitate the review and signing of payment transactions. It retrieves payment details from URL parameters, displays them to the user, and includes a `doSignAndSubmit` function that simulates transaction signing and submission. Upon completion, it notifies a backend endpoint (`/wallet/tx-callback`) with transaction details. The component also incorporates robust UI for loading, success, and error states, along with security reminders.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/server/webauthnController.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps: 27/10/2025, 21:53:30 - 27/10/2025, 22:11:14**: This Express router was created to handle WebAuthn registration and authentication flows on the backend. It uses `@simplewebauthn/server` to generate and verify challenges, storing challenges temporarily in-memory. It interacts with Prisma to persist WebAuthn credential metadata (ID, public key, counter) to the database, linked to user WhatsApp IDs. Critical comments were added to explicitly state that user private key material is *not* stored on the server.
    *   **Timestamps: 27/10/2025, 22:16:00 - 27/10/2025, 22:21:24**: Further refinements included casting the `prisma` client to `any` for more flexible runtime database access and adding `(c:any)` casts within map functions for `excludeCredentials` and `allowCredentials` to resolve TypeScript typing differences. The controller's `/assertion/verify` endpoint also has logic to execute a payment via `sendPayment` if a `paymentPayload` is present.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/page.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps: 28/10/2025, 00:33:13 - 28/10/2025, 00:33:35**: The main landing page for WattsPay was created, featuring a modern design with `framer-motion` animations. It outlines the project's value proposition ("Pay Anyone, Anywhere Without Leaving WhatsApp"), highlights Aptos integration, and showcases key features like "Lightning Payments," "Squad Bill Splitting," and "Fort Knox Escrow." It also includes a call to action for early access and a waitlist signup.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/scripts/send-whatsapp-test.mjs`**
    *   **Timestamp: 28/10/2025, 01:05:36**: This file was created as an empty placeholder, indicating an intention to add a script for testing WhatsApp message sending.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/bot/twilioClient.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps: 28/10/2025, 01:08:37 - 28/10/2025, 01:09:17**: This client for Twilio was introduced to abstract sending WhatsApp messages. It logs message attempts and includes specific error handling to provide clearer debugging information, particularly for common Twilio API errors like invalid sender numbers.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

The development log highlights a clear strategic direction for WattsPay:
1.  **Passkey-first Security Model**: A strong recurring pattern is the adoption and integration of passkeys (WebAuthn) for wallet creation and transaction authentication. This is evident across frontend components (`create/page.tsx`, `passkey-utils.ts`) and backend services (`webauthnController.ts`), emphasizing non-custodial key management where private keys are generated and encrypted on-device, never stored in plaintext on the server.
2.  **WhatsApp as a Primary User Interface**: The project leverages WhatsApp for conversational UX, deep links to web wallets, and bot integration, aiming to onboard a large user base to Aptos. This is supported by the `twilioClient.ts` for message sending and the `PITCH.md` document outlining the market strategy.
3.  **Aptos Blockchain Integration**: All core payment and wallet functionalities are built around the Aptos blockchain, utilizing its `ts-sdk` on the frontend and Move smart contracts (`payment_coordinator.move`) on-chain.
4.  **Iterative Development and Refinement**: Multiple commits to the same files, especially `create/page.tsx` and `webauthnController.ts`, indicate an iterative development process, with continuous improvements in functionality, typing, and clarity (e.g., extensive comments added to the `webauthnController`).
5.  **Focus on User Experience and Onboarding**: The frontend components are designed to simplify the wallet creation and transaction signing process, aiming for a "zero-seed-phrase" experience. The pitch document further underlines this focus.

## 03:28:02
The recent code changes show a strong focus on integrating passkey (WebAuthn) authentication and Aptos blockchain functionality within a WhatsApp-centric payment application called WattsPay. Key information from these changes highlights the evolution of wallet creation, core smart contract logic, backend WebAuthn handling, and a refined project pitch.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/create/page.tsx`**:
    *   **Initial development (27/10/2025, 04:49:46 - 27/10/2025, 21:34:25)**: Started as a React component for generating and submitting a wallet via a backup seed phrase. It used `@aptos-labs/ts-sdk` to generate accounts and interacted with a backend `/wallet/create-callback` endpoint, initially with an unspecified backend URL. The backend URL was later hardcoded to `https://65d7ad535a66.ngrok-free.app` at `04:50:09`.
    *   **Major refactor to Passkey-first (27/10/2025, 21:34:35)**: The page underwent a complete overhaul, discarding the seed-phrase flow in favor of a passkey-based approach. It now imports `PasskeyUtils` for WebAuthn operations. The initial implementation generated a *dummy* Aptos private key and used passkey assertions to derive a Key Encryption Key (KEK) to encrypt this key, storing it locally.
    *   **Refinement and API Integration (27/10/2025, 21:54:18 - 22:06:51)**: Corrected import paths for `PasskeyUtils` and refined React imports. The `handleCreateWithPasskey` function was updated to use a dynamically configured `API_BASE` for backend calls (from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`), and it now generates a *real* Aptos account locally, encrypts its private key using the KEK derived from the passkey, and sends this ciphertext (along with public key) to the backend.
    *   **Client-side On-chain Registration (28/10/2025, 03:20:32)**: A significant enhancement was added to perform on-chain user registration directly from the frontend after successful backend wallet creation. This involves normalizing the `waId` to a SHA-256 phone hash, building an Aptos transaction for `user_registry::register_user`, signing it locally with the generated private key, and submitting it to the Aptos devnet, ensuring true non-custodial key management and on-chain identity.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/contracts/payment_coordinator.move`**:
    *   **Initial implementation (27/10/2025, 17:16:18)**: This Move smart contract defines the core logic for WattsPay. It includes structs for `Payment` records, a global `PaymentRegistry`, and `PaymentRequest` functionality. It establishes error codes, payment statuses, and types. Key entry functions are `execute_payment` (direct transfers), `request_payment`, `approve_payment_request`, and `reject_payment_request`. It also specifies various view functions like `get_payment` to query payment details. The contract is designed to update user transaction statistics and reputation scores via `user_registry` calls.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/passkey-utils.ts`**:
    *   **Initial implementation (27/10/2025, 17:16:52)**: This utility file provides essential WebAuthn and cryptographic functions. It checks WebAuthn availability, converts between `ArrayBuffer` and Base64, wraps `navigator.credentials.create` for passkey registration and `navigator.credentials.get` for assertions. It implements HKDF-SHA256 for KEK derivation, AES-GCM for encryption/decryption, and helpers for deriving KEK from assertion signatures. Basic local storage functions are included for wallet payload saving.
    *   **Minor type refinement (27/10/2025, 17:21:59)**: A type cast for `attestationObject` was added, indicating minor code quality improvements.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/sign/page.tsx`**:
    *   **Initial implementation (27/10/2025, 21:43:12)**: This React page is for reviewing and signing payments. It parses payment payloads and `waId` from URL parameters. The `doSignAndSubmit` function simulates a transaction signing process (generating a dummy hash and adding a delay), then notifies a backend callback endpoint `/wallet/tx-callback`. The UI provides payment details, a signing button, and status feedback.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/server/webauthnController.ts`**:
    *   **Initial implementation (27/10/2025, 21:53:30)**: An Express router handles backend WebAuthn flows. It uses `@simplewebauthn/server` to generate and verify registration/authentication options. In-memory maps store challenges for verification. It persists WebAuthn credential metadata (credentialId, publicKey, counter) to a Prisma database. Crucially, after successful authentication, it can execute payments via `sendPayment` if a `paymentPayload` is provided, reinforcing the server's role in relayed, authorized payments. Explicit comments state that private keys are *not* stored on the server.
    *   **Refinement and Type Handling (27/10/2025, 22:11:14 - 22:21:24)**: Added comments clarifying challenge storage and non-storage of private keys. Introduced a `db: any = prisma` workaround for Prisma client typing issues and applied `any` type annotations to map and find functions to resolve TypeScript errors, ensuring runtime functionality without strict type conflicts during development.

    *   **Timestamp: 27/10/2025, 04:49:46 - 04:50:09**: An initial React page was created for wallet generation, allowing users to generate a private key (seed hex), copy, and download it. This version sent the raw private key to a backend callback, indicating an early stage of development or a temporary implementation. The backend URL for wallet creation was initially empty, then hardcoded to an `ngrok` URL.
    *   **Timestamp: 27/10/2025, 21:34:35 - 28/10/2025, 03:20:32**: The page underwent a major overhaul, shifting to a "Passkey-first" onboarding flow. It now imports `PasskeyUtils` for WebAuthn and cryptographic operations. The `handleCreateWithPasskey` function was introduced, which:
        1.  Creates a WebAuthn passkey credential.
        2.  Generates an Aptos account locally.
        3.  Derives a Key Encryption Key (KEK) from the WebAuthn assertion signature.
        4.  Encrypts the *local* Aptos private key using AES-GCM with the derived KEK.
        5.  Saves the encrypted private key (ciphertext) locally and sends this ciphertext (along with public key and address) to the backend `/wallet/create-callback`. This is a critical security enhancement, ensuring the plaintext private key never leaves the user's device.
        6.  Attempts non-custodial on-chain registration of the user by signing and submitting a `user_registry::register_user` transaction directly from the client. The backend URL is now dynamically fetched from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`.
    *   Multiple intermediate commits around 27/10/2025, 21:34 to 21:59 show a rapid iteration and refinement of this new passkey-based wallet creation logic, including adjustments to imports and UI status updates.

    *   **Timestamp: 27/10/2025, 17:16:18**: A new Move smart contract module was defined. It introduces `Payment`, `PaymentRegistry`, and `PaymentRequest` structs to manage payment flows. Key entry functions include `execute_payment` for direct transfers, `request_payment`, `approve_payment_request`, and `reject_payment_request`. It also defines events for real-time integration with external systems (like a WhatsApp bot). The contract handles balance checks, coin transfers, and updates user reputation.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/sign/page.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 27/10/2025, 21:43:12**: This new React page was created to allow users to review and sign payment transactions. It fetches payment payloads and WhatsApp IDs from URL parameters, simulates transaction signing (with a note for production implementation), and provides UI feedback on status and transaction hash. It notifies a backend endpoint (`/wallet/tx-callback`) after a simulated submission.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/server/webauthnController.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 27/10/2025, 21:53:30 - 22:21:24**: This new Express router handles WebAuthn (passkey) registration and authentication on the backend. It uses `@simplewebauthn/server` to generate and verify challenges. It stores `credentialId` and `publicKey` (base64 encoded) and a counter for replay protection in the Prisma database, linking them to users by their WhatsApp ID. Importantly, it reiterates that no plaintext private key material is stored on the server. If a payment payload is provided during assertion verification, it proceeds to execute the payment via `sendPayment`. Minor typing adjustments (`as any`, `(c:any) =>`) were applied to handle Prisma client interaction.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/bot/twilioClient.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 28/10/2025, 01:08:37**: This new TypeScript file provides functionality to send WhatsApp messages using the Twilio API.

## 13:51:55
The development log for the `wattspay` project showcases a rapid evolution across its frontend, backend, and smart contracts, with a strong focus on secure, user-friendly blockchain interactions through WhatsApp.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/create/page.tsx`**
    *   **Initial (27/10/2025, 04:49:46)**: Started as a wallet creation page using Aptos SDK to generate a private key (secretHex) and address. It allowed copying/downloading the seed and posted details to a backend callback. The backend URL was initially a placeholder, then updated to an `ngrok` tunnel (`https://65d7ad535a66.ngrok-free.app`) within minutes.
    *   **Major Refactor (27/10/2025, 21:34:35)**: The page underwent a significant overhaul, transitioning from direct seed phrase generation to a **Passkey-first wallet creation** flow. This new implementation utilizes `PasskeyUtils` for WebAuthn credential management, key derivation, and AES-GCM encryption, storing the encrypted private key locally. Backend interaction shifted to dedicated WebAuthn registration/verification endpoints. A recurring issue of duplicating the old component's code alongside the new one was observed in subsequent minor updates on the same day.
    *   **On-chain Integration & SDK Usage Fluctuation (28/10/2025, 03:11:02 - 13:45:24)**: The client-side on-chain registration logic for the Aptos `user_registry` smart contract was introduced, removed (to reduce frontend bundle size), and then re-integrated multiple times. Initial implementations involved `AptosClient` for transaction building and signing, then a brief attempt to replace Aptos SDK with `crypto.getRandomValues` and `tweetnacl` for key generation, before reverting back to `Account.generate()` from `@aptos-labs/ts-sdk` and `AptosClient` for on-chain interactions. The `API_BASE` for backend calls was consistently sourced from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/contracts/payment_coordinator.move` (27/10/2025, 17:16:18)**: This Move smart contract defines the core payment logic. It includes structs for `Payment`, `PaymentRegistry`, and `PaymentRequest`, along with various error codes, payment statuses (pending, completed, failed, refunded, expired), and types (direct, request, group). It outlines entry functions for `execute_payment`, `request_payment`, `approve_payment_request`, and `reject_payment_request`, and also includes view functions like `get_payment`. The contract interacts with a `user_registry` module to manage user eligibility and addresses, and updates user transaction statistics and reputation scores.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/passkey-utils.ts` (27/10/2025, 17:16:52)**: This utility file provides essential functions for WebAuthn (passkey) and cryptographic operations. It includes helpers for WebAuthn availability checks, base64 conversions, creating and asserting WebAuthn credentials, HKDF-SHA256 key derivation, AES-GCM encryption/decryption, and local storage management for encrypted wallet data. Minor typing improvements were made on 27/10/2025, 17:21:59.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/sign/page.tsx`**
    *   **Initial (27/10/2025, 21:43:12)**: Began as a page to display payment details and **simulate** transaction signing, generating a random transaction hash and notifying a backend callback.
    *   **Passkey Integration (28/10/2025, 13:32:44)**: Refactored to integrate a real WebAuthn assertion flow. The `doSignAndSubmit` function now fetches assertion options from the backend, uses `navigator.credentials.get` for user authentication via passkey, and sends the assertion response to the backend for verification and atomic payment execution.
    *   **Client-side Signing Re-introduction (28/10/2025, 13:35:17 & 13:37:00)**: A temporary state with duplicate default exports was introduced, where one component performed client-side Aptos transaction signing using `PasskeyUtils` for key decryption and `@aptos-labs/ts-sdk` for building/signing. This was resolved by removing the older, server-relayed signing component and making the client-side signing (utilizing PasskeyUtils and Aptos SDK for local signing before relaying the signed BCS) the primary implementation.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/server/webauthnController.ts`**
    *   **Initial (27/10/2025, 21:53:30)**: Implemented server-side endpoints for WebAuthn registration and authentication, using `@simplewebauthn/server`. It manages in-memory challenges, persists credential metadata (ID, public key) to Prisma, updates replay counters, and can optionally trigger payment execution upon successful assertion verification.

It strongly emphasizes the use of WebAuthn and Aptos blockchain.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/test-p2p-payment.js`**
    *   **Initial (28/10/2025, 02:54:53)**: A test script for P2P payments using `WattsPayService`. It simulates creating and funding two Aptos accounts, registers them on-chain with generated phone numbers, executes a payment, and logs balances and transaction details.
    *   **Refinement (28/10/2025, 03:34:19)**: Updated the Aptos API key, improved phone number generation, and added steps to verify on-chain registration via view functions, providing richer output for testing.

    *   **Initial (28/10/2025, 13:20:18)**: The main Express server setup. It handles Twilio webhooks, parses WhatsApp commands (create, import, receive, help, balance, history, send, confirm), manages user onboarding (linking to frontend wallet pages), interacts with various services for wallet provisioning, balance checks, payment processing, and transaction history. It also mounts the `webauthnRouter` for passkey operations.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

*   **Passkey-first Security**: The most prominent pattern is the consistent effort to integrate WebAuthn (passkeys) for cryptographic operations, aiming for a non-custodial and phishing-resistant user experience. This involves deriving encryption keys from WebAuthn assertion signatures and storing encrypted private keys locally on the user's device.
*   **Aptos Blockchain as Core**: All financial and identity-related operations are designed to interact with the Aptos blockchain, utilizing its SDK and custom Move smart contracts (`user_registry`, `payment_coordinator`, `group_treasury`).
*   **WhatsApp as User Interface**: WhatsApp serves as the primary conversational front-end for users, leveraging Twilio's API to send commands, receive responses, and navigate to web-based wallet interfaces via deep links.
*   **Frontend-Backend Separation**: A clear distinction exists between frontend components (React/Next.js for wallet UI) and backend services (Express.js for API, webhook handling, and WebAuthn verification), communicating via API calls, often through `ngrok` tunnels in development.
*   **Environment-Driven Configuration**: Extensive use of environment variables for configuring critical parameters like API keys, blockchain node URLs, and smart contract addresses, managed and validated by `zod` in the backend.
*   **Iterative Development**: Multiple revisions of key frontend components (`create/page.tsx`, `sign/page.tsx`) show an iterative process of refining the user experience, security model, and technical implementation choices (e.g., how Aptos SDK is utilized on the client-side).
*   **Emphasis on Non-Custodial Design**: Throughout the code and documentation, there is a strong emphasis on ensuring that plaintext private keys never leave the user's device or are stored on the server, a key security principle for decentralized applications.
*   **Temporary Solutions for Demo**: Notes within the code indicate that some components, such as in-memory challenge storage and local storage for encrypted wallets, are temporary for demo purposes and would require more robust solutions in a production environment.

## 15:57:55
The code change log primarily details updates to a frontend application related to blockchain wallet creation and a UI feature component, all occurring on **28/10/2025**.

### File-Specific Updates:

#### `/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/create/page.tsx`

This file, responsible for the "Create Wallet" page, underwent several iterative refinements:

*   **14:57:25**: The initial version established a comprehensive passkey (WebAuthn) based wallet creation flow. This involved requesting registration options from a backend server, creating a passkey credential on the device, sending attestation to the server for verification, locally generating an Aptos keypair, deriving an encryption key (KEK) via another passkey assertion, encrypting the private key, saving the encrypted wallet locally, and finally registering the wallet with the backend. It also included an on-chain registration step on Aptos, hashing the `waId` (WhatsApp ID) and submitting a transaction to a user registry.
*   **14:58:28**: A minor refactor occurred, renaming a local variable from `publicKey` to `aptosPublicKey` when generating the Aptos keypair. This introduced a temporary bug where the old `publicKey` variable was still referenced in subsequent steps, leading to potential issues.
*   **14:59:56**: No discernible functional changes from the previous timestamp; the variable discrepancy persisted.
*   **15:01:26**: Crucial bug fixes were implemented. The `PasskeyUtils.saveEncryptedWallet` function and the backend `fetch` call for `/wallet/create-callback` were updated to correctly use the `aptosPublicKey` variable. Additionally, the instantiation of `Ed25519PrivateKey` was updated from `Ed25519PrivateKey.fromHex(privateKeyHex)` to `new Ed25519PrivateKey(privateKeyHex)`.
*   **15:01:59**: A small adjustment was made to the Aptos transaction generation, changing `acct.address().hex()` to `acct.address()`.
*   **15:02:05**: No functional changes were observed in this timestamp.
*   **15:05:48**: This timestamp marks a significant refactoring of the Aptos on-chain transaction logic. The older `client.generateTransaction`, `client.signTransaction`, and `submitSignedBCSTransaction` methods were replaced with modern Aptos SDK calls: `client.transaction.build.simple`, `client.signAndSubmitTransaction`, and `client.waitForTransaction`. This update streamlines the transaction handling. A `finally` block was also added to reset the `isCreating` state, improving UI responsiveness and error handling. The JSX for the `CreateWalletPage` component, which was potentially truncated in earlier logs, was also fully visible, showing a clear UI structure with status alerts and a creation button.
*   **15:06:00**: A minor TypeScript type assertion (`as `${string}::${string}::${string}``) was added to the `function` property within the transaction payload, enhancing type safety without altering runtime behavior.

#### `/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/components/feature.tsx`

*   **15:10:03**: This entry describes the creation of a `Feature` React component. This component visually showcases different "Wattspay" functionalities ("payments", "groups", "escrow") using animated chat previews. It leverages `framer-motion` for smooth animations and transitions, including staggered message displays and hover effects. The chat bubbles feature sender/receiver differentiation, timestamps, and "delivered" checkmarks. A "Replay demo" button allows re-triggering the animations.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Consistent Development Activity**: All logged changes occurred on the same day, suggesting active development or debugging sessions focused on these frontend components.
*   **Aptos Blockchain Integration**: Both files indicate a strong focus on integrating with the Aptos blockchain, particularly for wallet management and transactional features.
*   **Passkey/WebAuthn Emphasis**: The wallet creation page heavily relies on Passkey for secure and user-friendly authentication and private key encryption, demonstrating a commitment to modern authentication standards.
*   **Frontend Technology Stack**: The use of React, Next.js (`"use client"` directive, `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_...`), and `framer-motion` (for `feature.tsx`) points to a modern, component-based frontend architecture.
*   **Backend API Interaction**: The `CreateWalletPage` frequently interacts with a backend API (e.g., `/webauthn/register/options`, `/wallet/create-callback`), indicating a client-server architecture.
*   **Environment Variable Usage**: Configuration details like API base URLs, user registry addresses, and Aptos network settings are consistently drawn from `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_...` variables, highlighting a reliance on environment-specific configurations.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: The `CreateWalletPage` log shows a clear pattern of iterative development, from initial implementation to bug fixes and API/SDK refactors, particularly for the Aptos transaction submission logic.

## 16:58:00
The log details code changes across several files related to a blockchain application called WattsPay, focusing on wallet management, WebAuthn integration, and blockchain interactions.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/create/page.tsx`**: This file, responsible for the wallet creation page, underwent several iterative updates between 14:57:25 and 16:56:59 on 28/10/2025.
    *   Initial changes involved renaming a `publicKey` variable to `aptosPublicKey` for clarity in wallet data storage and API calls (14:58:28).
    *   The instantiation of `Ed25519PrivateKey` was updated from `Ed25519PrivateKey.fromHex(privateKeyHex)` to `new Ed25519PrivateKey(privateKeyHex)` (15:01:26).
    *   A significant refactor occurred in the on-chain registration logic, shifting from older Aptos SDK methods (`client.generateTransaction`, `client.signTransaction`, `submitSignedBCSTransaction`) to the newer, more streamlined `client.transaction.build.simple` and `client.signAndSubmitTransaction` (15:05:48). This update also completed the error handling (`catch` and `finally`) for the `handleCreateWithPasskey` function.
    *   A minor TypeScript type cast was added to the `function` argument within the transaction builder (15:06:00).
    *   Further adjustments were made to the `attestationResponse` structure, specifically ensuring `rawId` is correctly base64url encoded, and a `bufferToBase64url` helper was introduced (16:56:48, 16:56:59).

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/components/feature.tsx`**: Between 15:10:03 and 15:58:24, this component, which displays animated chat previews for various features (payments, groups, escrow), showed no discernible functional code changes. The multiple entries likely represent minor formatting changes or frequent saves.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/index.ts`**: Across numerous timestamps between 16:03:35 and 16:25:07, no functional code changes were observed in the main Express server file. It consistently handles Twilio webhooks, user and wallet management, and delegates to other services.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/wallet/paymentService.ts`**: From 16:04:20 to 16:04:43, no functional code changes were present. This service maintains its responsibility for initiating APT payments, handling transaction submission, gas estimation, and Aptos address validation.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/server/webauthnController.ts`**: No functional changes were observed from 16:04:49 to 16:07:13. This controller remains focused on managing WebAuthn registration and authentication flows, including challenge generation, verification, and persistence of credential metadata.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/scripts/seed-phone-wallet.ts`**: This script for seeding test users and wallets underwent significant revisions.
    *   Initially, it funded new wallets via the Aptos faucet (16:14:43).
    *   This was later changed to transfer APT from a hardcoded "funded devnet account" private key (`0x3736...`), and the on-chain user registration step was temporarily commented out (16:29:33).
    *   The script was further refined (16:36:29, 16:36:36) to use a different "testnet publisher private key" (`0xc92f...`), reduced the transfer amount from 10 APT to 1 APT, and improved error messages to guide users on funding the publisher account. The `encryptString` call was also simplified.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/move_contracts/Move.toml`**: This new file was introduced at 16:34:21, defining the Move package `wattspay_contracts` with version "1.0.0", setting a `wattspay` address, and declaring a dependency on `AptosFramework`.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/wallet/walletService.ts`**: This service was updated to include a `registerUserOnChain` function. The method for referencing the user registry contract address within this function transitioned from using a generic `process.env.APTOS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` to the explicitly imported and correctly referenced `env.USER_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` (16:50:53).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **28/10/2025, 14:58:28**: Frontend wallet creation page variable renaming.
*   **28/10/2025, 15:05:48**: Frontend Aptos SDK transaction building logic updated and error handling completed.
*   **28/10/2025, 16:29:33**: Test wallet seeding script changed funding mechanism from faucet to direct transfer and commented out on-chain registration.
*   **28/10/2025, 16:34:21**: New Move contract configuration file (`Move.toml`) introduced.
*   **28/10/2025, 16:36:29**: Test wallet seeding script updated with a new funded private key and reduced transfer amount, along with enhanced funding instructions.
*   **28/10/2025, 16:50:53**: Wallet service updated to use specific environment variables for contract addresses in on-chain registration.
*   **28/10/2025, 16:56:59**: Frontend wallet creation page adjusted WebAuthn attestation response `rawId` handling and added a base64url conversion helper.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Aptos Blockchain Integration:** A core theme is the continuous development and refinement of interactions with the Aptos blockchain, including account generation, transaction building, signing, and submission using the `@aptos-labs/ts-sdk`.
*   **WebAuthn/Passkey Focus:** Both frontend and backend components demonstrate a strong emphasis on WebAuthn for secure, passwordless authentication and key management, involving complex challenge-response flows and local private key encryption.
*   **Environment-based Configuration:** The codebase consistently uses environment variables (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`, `USER_REGISTRY_ADDRESS`, `APTOS_NODE_URL`) to manage configuration, suggesting adaptability across different deployment environments (devnet, testnet, mainnet).
*   **Robust Error Handling & Logging:** `try...catch` blocks and structured logging (`logger.error`, `console.warn`) are widely used to manage potential failures and provide debugging information.
*   **Identifier Normalization:** Phone numbers and WhatsApp IDs are systematically normalized (e.g., stripping prefixes, whitespace) before use, indicating a focus on consistent data handling.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Multiple identical or near-identical log entries for several files suggest a pattern of frequent saving, possibly during active development or without significant functional changes between saves. Functional changes are often incremental, particularly within the frontend wallet creation flow and the test seeding script.

## 17:57:20
The provided log entries detail changes across three distinct files: `Frontend/app/wallet/create/page.tsx`, `Frontend/components/feature.tsx`, `src/index.ts`, `src/wallet/paymentService.ts`, `src/server/webauthnController.ts`, `scripts/seed-phone-wallet.ts`, `move_contracts/Move.toml`, and `.env`.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/create/page.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps**: Consistent changes between 28/10/2025, 15:01:26 and 28/10/2025, 17:30:36.
    *   **Key Changes**:
        *   **Aptos SDK Transaction Building**: An initial significant change occurred around 15:05:48, updating the Aptos transaction generation method from `client.generateTransaction` to `client.transaction.build.simple` and `client.signAndSubmitTransaction`, standardizing how transactions are constructed and signed. This also introduced `client.waitForTransaction` instead of `waitForTransactionWithResult`.
        *   **WebAuthn Attestation Response Handling**: Several updates were made around 16:56:48 and 17:23:36 to refine the `attestationResponse` structure sent to the backend. Specifically, the `rawId` field was initially set as `btoa(String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array((cred.rawId as ArrayBuffer))))`, then simplified to `cred.id` (which is already base64url encoded), and later updated to use new helper functions (`bufferToBase64url`) for consistent base64url encoding of `rawId`, `clientDataJSON`, and `attestationObject`. The `type: 'public-key'` field was also explicitly added to the `attestationResponse` around 17:23:36.
        *   **Frontend Logic for On-chain Registration**: The section for on-chain user registration (using `user_registry::register_user` on Aptos) was consistently present, handling `waId` normalization, SHA-256 hashing of the phone number, and submitting the transaction. Error handling for on-chain registration was also present and logged as non-fatal.
        *   **WebAuthn Assertion Verification**: The client-side assertion verification process, including deriving a Key Encryption Key (KEK) from the assertion signature and encrypting the Aptos private key locally, remained consistent throughout the logs. The `webauthn/assertion/verify` call was commented out around 17:23:36, indicating it might be redundant or handled differently.
        *   **Environment Variables**: Usage of `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_REGISTRY_ADDRESS`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APTOS_NODE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APTOS_API_KEY`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APTOS_NETWORK` for configuration remained constant.

2.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/components/feature.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps**: Minor changes observed between 28/10/2025, 15:10:03 and 28/10/2025, 15:58:24.
    *   **Key Changes**: No functional changes are visible in the provided code snippets across these timestamps. The content remained identical, suggesting minor formatting, whitespace, or non-functional edits were made and saved. This file defines UI components for a chat preview, including `Checkmarks` and `ChatBubble` for displaying messages, and `ChatPreview` to render mock conversations related to payments, groups, and escrow, utilizing `framer-motion` for animations.

3.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/index.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps**: Frequent minor changes between 28/10/2025, 16:03:35 and 28/10/2025, 16:25:07.
    *   **Key Changes**: No functional changes are visible across the provided snippets. The core logic for handling Twilio WhatsApp webhooks, parsing commands (`create`, `import`, `receive`, `help`, `balance`, `history`, `send`, `confirm`), and interacting with user and wallet repositories (Prisma) remained identical. This backend service integrates with WebAuthn routes and manages wallet operations on the Aptos blockchain.

4.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/wallet/paymentService.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps**: Minimal changes between 28/10/2025, 16:04:20 and 28/10/2025, 16:51:15.
    *   **Key Changes**:
        *   **Environment Variable for Contract Address**: A specific change around 16:50:53 involved replacing `process.env.APTOS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with `env.USER_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` within the `registerUserOnChain` function. This refines the reference to the user registry smart contract address.
        *   **General Stability**: Otherwise, the service remained largely stable, defining interfaces for payments, implementing `sendPayment` and `estimatePaymentGas` functions, and providing utilities for Aptos address validation and APT/octas conversion. It handles transaction lifecycle from creation to confirmation and error handling.

5.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/server/webauthnController.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps**: Significant revisions between 28/10/2025, 16:04:49 and 28/10/2025, 17:23:06.
    *   **Key Changes**:
        *   **`verifyRegistrationResponse` and `verifyAuthenticationResponse` API Usage**: A major recurring pattern of changes is the adjustment to how `verifyRegistrationResponse` and `verifyAuthenticationResponse` from `@simplewebauthn/server` are called.
            *   Initially, both were called with a spread `...({...} as any)` pattern, indicating type casting.
            *   Around 17:07:33, `verifyRegistrationResponse` was explicitly changed to accept `attestationResponse` as the first argument and an options object as the second, aligning with a potential change in the `simplewebauthn` library's API or a correction to its usage.
            *   Further refinements around 17:08:14 and subsequent timestamps show a shift back to passing the `attestationResponse` spread into the options object (`{ ...attestationResponse, expectedChallenge, ... } as any`), then back to a dedicated `credential: attestationResponse` field within the options object for `verifyRegistrationResponse` at 17:20:27, and finally returning to `{ ...attestationResponse, expectedChallenge, ... } as any` at 17:20:42.
            *   The `verifyAuthenticationResponse` function also saw similar rapid changes in its call signature, mostly toggling between passing the credential directly as the first argument, embedding it in an options object, or spreading its properties into the options object. The final state in the log (17:23:06) uses a spread `...({...} as any)` pattern for both.
        *   **Debugging Logs**: Multiple `console.log` statements were added (e.g., `console.log('Received attestationResponse:', ...)`) within the `register/verify` endpoint, indicating active debugging efforts to understand the incoming `attestationResponse` structure, particularly its `id`, `rawId`, and `response` fields.
        *   **In-memory Challenge Storage**: The use of `registrationChallenges` and `authenticationChallenges` as in-memory `Record<string, string>` for storing WebAuthn challenges for a short duration remains consistent. This is noted as a demo approach, with a recommendation for production to use Redis or a database with TTL.

6.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/scripts/seed-phone-wallet.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps**: Frequent updates between 28/10/2025, 16:14:43 and 28/10/2025, 17:51:44.
    *   **Key Changes**:
        *   **Wallet Funding Strategy**:
            *   Initially (16:14:43), the script used `aptos.fundAccount` (faucet) to fund newly generated wallets with 10 APT.
            *   Around 16:29:33, it switched to transferring APT from a *known funded devnet account* (using a hardcoded private key `0x37368b...`) instead of the faucet, reducing the amount to 10 APT. This change also commented out the on-chain user registration step, noting the wallet might need manual funding.
            *   Further refinement at 16:36:29 replaced the generic funded account with a specific `testnet_publisher` account private key (`0xc92f20...`) and reduced the transfer amount to 1 APT (100,000,000 octas). This change also removed the `testKek` parameter from `encryptString`.
            *   Subsequent updates (17:44:06 onwards) changed the transfer amount to 0.1 APT (10,000,000 octas) and introduced more explicit conditional logic and warnings around on-chain registration failing due to insufficient gas balance, advising manual funding. The amount was then reverted to 1 APT at 17:51:34.
        *   **On-chain Registration Logic**: The on-chain registration part was initially active, then commented out, and later re-enabled within a `try-catch` block (around 17:45:30) to handle potential failures like insufficient balance, and to use a `normalizedPhone` number (without `+` prefix) as a function argument.
        *   **Console Logging**: Extensive `console.log` statements were added/modified throughout to provide detailed progress and debugging information during the seeding process, especially regarding wallet creation, funding, and on-chain registration status.

7.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/.env`**
    *   **Timestamps**: Frequent changes between 28/10/2025, 16:18:07 and 28/10/2025, 17:04:15.
    *   **Key Changes**:
        *   **APTOS_NODE_URL and APTOS_NETWORK**: The `APTOS_NODE_URL` and `APTOS_NETWORK` frequently toggled between `devnet` and `testnet` values (e.g., from `https://fullnode.devnet.aptoslabs.com/v1` to `https://fullnode.testnet.aptoslabs.com/v1`).
        *   **New Environment Variable**: A new environment variable, `TESTNET_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY`, was added around 16:53:16 to store a private key for funding testnet wallets, reflecting changes in the `seed-phone-wallet.ts` script.

    *   **Timestamp**: Only one entry on 28/10/2025, 16:34:21.
    *   **Key Changes**: This file specifies the Move package details, including name, version, authors, and important `[addresses]` and `[dev-addresses]` for `wattspay` contract with the address `0xe96e05df3945f96d8dc482bd57d856c3acfc50be872bfd33f2c78ff1b7bf2471`. It also lists `AptosFramework` as a dependency. The log shows no changes for this file, indicating it remained stable within the provided timeframe.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Aptos Blockchain Integration**: A core theme across the frontend and backend is the deep integration with the Aptos blockchain, including account generation, transaction building, signing, submission, and waiting for confirmation.
*   **WebAuthn for Authentication**: The project heavily utilizes WebAuthn (Passkeys) for secure user authentication and key management. Both frontend and backend components are continuously being refined to correctly implement and verify WebAuthn registration and assertion flows.
*   **Environmental Variables for Configuration**: The widespread use of `process.env.*` variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE`, `APTOS_NETWORK`, `USER_REGISTRY_ADDRESS`, etc.) indicates a configurable system that can adapt to different deployment environments (e.g., `devnet` vs. `testnet`).
*   **Debugging and Error Handling**: Numerous `console.log` and `logger.error`/`logger.warn` statements are present, suggesting an active development and debugging phase where developers are closely monitoring data flow and error conditions. Specific error messages like "Passkey verification failed," "Failed to get registration options," and "Insufficient balance for transaction" are common.
*   **Data Serialization/Deserialization**: Frequent conversions between ArrayBuffer, base64, and base64url strings are necessary when interacting with WebAuthn APIs and handling cryptographic payloads. Helper functions (`base64urlToBuffer`, `bufferToBase64`, `bufferToBase64url`) were added and adjusted in the frontend to manage these conversions.
*   **Consistent Component Structure**: The `CreateWalletPage` in the frontend consistently uses React `useState` and `useEffect` hooks, along with UI components (`Button`, `Card`, `Alert`) from `@/components/ui`. The `Feature` component also maintains a consistent structure for displaying interactive chat previews with `framer-motion` animations.
*   **Backend API Endpoints**: The backend (`src/index.ts` and `src/server/webauthnController.ts`) consistently exposes API endpoints for `/webhook/whatsapp` (Twilio integration) and `/webauthn/*` (Passkey registration/authentication), demonstrating a clear separation of concerns.
*   **Database Interactions**: The backend frequently interacts with a Prisma client (`prisma`) to manage user and wallet data, including creating users, finding wallets, and persisting WebAuthn credentials.
*   **Test Script Evolution**: The `seed-phone-wallet.ts` script shows an iterative development process, first using the Aptos faucet, then a hardcoded funded account, and continually refining the on-chain registration and funding logic with more robust error handling and guidance for developers.

These changes collectively reflect ongoing development and refinement of a blockchain-based payment system (`wattspay`) that leverages WhatsApp for user interaction and WebAuthn for secure wallet management on the Aptos network.
