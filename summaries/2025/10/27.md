The file `/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/create/page.tsx` is a React component responsible for creating a new WattsPay wallet.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/create/page.tsx`**:
    *   **Initial State (27/10/2025, 04:49:46)**: This file defines the `CreateWalletPage` component. It allows users to generate a new Aptos blockchain account (represented by a `secretHex` private key and an `address`), provides options to copy or download this seed, and then submits the wallet details to a backend endpoint. At this point, the `backendUrl` variable within the `submitWallet` function was an empty string, implying a placeholder or local configuration not explicitly defined in the code.
    *   **Subsequent Change (27/10/2025, 04:50:09)**: The `backendUrl` in the `submitWallet` function was updated from an empty string to `https://65d7ad535a66.ngrok-free.app`. This is a critical change, as it directs the wallet creation callback to a specific, publicly accessible `ngrok` tunnel, likely for testing or remote development purposes.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **27/10/2025, 04:50:09**: The key modification was the update of the `backendUrl` in the `CreateWalletPage` component, switching from an undefined endpoint to a specific `ngrok` URL for backend communication.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Aptos Blockchain Integration**: The code heavily relies on `@aptos-labs/ts-sdk` for generating new Aptos accounts and handling private/public keys, indicating a core functionality related to the Aptos blockchain.
*   **User Interface Components**: The component uses a consistent set of UI elements from a local library (`@/components/ui/button`, `card`, `alert`), suggesting a standardized design system across the frontend.
*   **Asynchronous Operations**: Wallet generation and submission involve asynchronous operations (`async/await`) for API calls and blockchain interactions.
*   **State Management**: `useState` is used extensively for managing the component's UI state (e.g., `secretHex`, `address`, `isCreating`, `success`, `copied`).
*   **Backend Interaction**: The component communicates with a backend API via `fetch` to persist wallet information, highlighting a client-server architecture.
*   **Security Emphasis**: The UI includes prominent alerts emphasizing the importance of securing the backup seed and warning against sharing it.

## 06:31:27
The primary change observed is an update within the `/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/create/page.tsx` file.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/create/page.tsx`**: This file, responsible for the wallet creation user interface, shows a single functional change.
    *   Initially, at **27/10/2025, 04:49:46**, the `backendUrl` constant was an empty string, meaning API calls would likely fail or target the current origin.
    *   This was quickly updated at **27/10/2025, 04:50:09** to point to a specific `ngrok-free.app` URL (`https://65d7ad535a66.ngrok-free.app`). This indicates the development environment was configured to connect to a specific, publicly accessible backend endpoint for wallet creation callbacks.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

*   **27/10/2025, 04:49:46** and **04:50:09**: These timestamps mark the immediate identification and correction/configuration of the backend URL within the frontend wallet creation logic.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**

*   The code within `page.tsx` consistently uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for state management and UI components (`Button`, `Card`, `Alert`) for presentation. It integrates with Aptos blockchain SDK (`Account`, `Ed25519PrivateKey`) for local wallet generation. The process involves generating a private key (seed), deriving an address, allowing the user to copy/download the seed, and then sending the wallet details (WA ID, address, public key, encrypted private key) to a backend endpoint. Error handling with `alert` messages and `console.error` is present throughout the `generateSeed` and `submitWallet` functions.
