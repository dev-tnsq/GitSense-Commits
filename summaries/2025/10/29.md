# Activity Summary for 29/10/2025

## 00:01:14
The provided logs indicate activity across several files related to a blockchain project named "wattspay", focusing heavily on WebAuthn (passkey) integration and cryptographic utilities. All recorded changes for specific files appear to be snapshots of the same content, implying no actual code modifications were made within the logged timestamps for those files.

**File-Specific Updates and Significant Timestamps:**

1.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/server/webauthnController.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 28/10/2025, 19:30:39 to 28/10/2025, 19:34:27.
    *   **Summary:** This TypeScript file implements the server-side logic for WebAuthn (passkey) registration and authentication. It uses the `@simplewebauthn/server` library to generate and verify registration and authentication options/responses. It interacts with a Prisma client (`prisma`) to store WebAuthn credential metadata (credential ID, public key, counter) linked to user accounts. Key functions include `generateRegistrationOptions`, `verifyRegistrationResponse`, `generateAuthenticationOptions`, `verifyAuthenticationResponse`. It manages in-memory challenges (`registrationChallenges`, `authenticationChallenges`) and includes utility functions for `base64` and `base64url` conversions. It also contains logic to potentially trigger a payment via `sendPayment` after successful authentication, if a payment payload is present. The content remained identical across all logged timestamps for this file.

2.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/passkey-utils.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 28/10/2025, 19:34:38 to 28/10/2025, 19:35:09.
    *   **Summary:** This TypeScript file provides frontend utility functions for WebAuthn and cryptographic operations, specifically for passkey-backed Aptos wallets. It includes helpers for WebAuthn feature detection (`isWebAuthnAvailable`), creating new WebAuthn credentials (`createWebAuthnCredential`), and obtaining assertions (`getWebAuthnAssertion`). It also features comprehensive cryptographic utilities for Key Derivation Functions (HKDF-SHA256 via `deriveKeyFromSecret`, `deriveKekFromAssertionSignature`) and AES-GCM encryption/decryption (`aesGcmEncrypt`, `aesGcmDecrypt`). Furthermore, it contains base64/base64url conversion functions and simple local storage wrappers for encrypted wallets. The content remained identical across all logged timestamps for this file.

3.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/delete-corrupted-wallet.js`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 28/10/2025, 19:40:40 to 28/10/2025, 19:42:43.
    *   **Summary:** This JavaScript utility script uses `@prisma/client` to connect to a database and delete a specific "corrupted" wallet identified by the ID `cmhamjhpo0003ne9znod2smu3`. Before deleting the wallet itself, it ensures all associated transactions (where the wallet is either sender or recipient) are also deleted. This indicates a maintenance script for data integrity. The content remained identical across all logged timestamps for this file.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **WebAuthn (Passkey) Integration:** A dominant theme is the deep integration of WebAuthn for secure user authentication, spanning both frontend and backend components. The server handles challenge generation and response verification, while the frontend provides the user interface and cryptographic operations for credential management.
*   **Cryptographic Operations:** Frequent use of base64/base64url encoding/decoding is observed in both server-side and frontend WebAuthn-related files for handling binary data (credential IDs, public keys, challenge bytes). The frontend also explicitly includes HKDF and AES-GCM for key derivation and encryption, suggesting sensitive data (like wallet keys) is encrypted using keys derived from WebAuthn assertions.
*   **Prisma ORM:** The backend (`webauthnController.ts` and `delete-corrupted-wallet.js`) consistently uses Prisma for database interactions, managing users, WebAuthn credentials, wallets, and transactions.
*   **Error Handling:** All API routes and utility functions include `try...catch` blocks for robust error handling, returning 400 (bad request), 404 (not found), or 500 (internal server error) responses.
*   **Challenge-Response Mechanism:** Both the frontend and backend are designed around a challenge-response protocol for WebAuthn, where the server issues challenges that the client must sign with their passkey.
*   **Redundancy in Logs:** Multiple identical entries for the same files within very short timeframes suggest continuous saving, automatic code formatting, or a logging mechanism that captures file state even without explicit content changes.

## 00:59:19
The log details changes across two primary code files and a utility script, all occurring on October 28, 2025.

**File-specific updates:**

1.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/src/server/webauthnController.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 19:30:39, 19:30:48, 19:34:21, 19:34:27.
    *   This file defines an Express router for handling WebAuthn (passkey) registration and authentication processes. It integrates with `@simplewebauthn/server` for core WebAuthn logic and `prisma` for database interactions.
    *   Key functionalities include:
        *   Generating registration options (`/register/options`) and verifying registration responses (`/register/verify`), persisting new credentials (ID, public key, counter) in the database.
        *   Generating authentication options (`/assertion/options`) and verifying authentication responses (`/assertion/verify`), updating credential counters for replay protection.
        *   It uses in-memory maps (`registrationChallenges`, `authenticationChallenges`) to store challenges for verification.
        *   Utility functions handle base64/base64url conversions and determine the Relying Party ID (`rpId`) and origin from environment variables.
    *   **Observation:** All four entries for this file show identical content, indicating no functional code changes were made or committed between these timestamps. The rapid succession of timestamps suggests non-substantive saves or automated formatting.

2.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/Frontend/app/wallet/passkey-utils.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 19:34:38, 19:34:47, 19:34:56, 19:35:09.
    *   This frontend utility file provides essential WebAuthn and cryptographic helpers for passkey-backed wallets, specifically noting its relevance for Aptos wallets.
    *   It includes:
        *   `isWebAuthnAvailable`: A feature detection function.
        *   Base64/Base64Url conversion utilities (`toBase64`, `fromBase64`, etc.).
        *   `createWebAuthnCredential`: A wrapper for initiating WebAuthn credential creation, suggesting support for EdDSA/Ed25519 and ES256 algorithms.
        *   `getWebAuthnAssertion`: A wrapper for initiating WebAuthn authentication.
        *   Cryptographic functions for Key Derivation using HKDF-SHA256 (`deriveKeyFromSecret`, `deriveKekFromAssertionSignature`) and AES-GCM encryption/decryption (`aesGcmEncrypt`, `aesGcmDecrypt`).
        *   Simple local storage wrappers (`saveEncryptedWallet`, `loadEncryptedWallet`) for wallet data, with a note to use IndexedDB in production.
    *   **Observation:** Similar to the `webauthnController.ts` file, all four entries for `passkey-utils.ts` contain identical code, indicating no functional changes within this specific log interval.

3.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/wattspay/delete-corrupted-wallet.js`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 19:40:40, 19:42:43.
    *   This script utilizes `PrismaClient` to delete a specific "corrupted" wallet by its ID (`cmhamjhpo0003ne9znod2smu3`).
    *   It ensures data integrity by first deleting all associated transactions (where the wallet is either sender or recipient) before deleting the wallet record itself.
    *   Includes console logging for the deletion process and error handling.
    *   **Observation:** Both entries for this file show identical content, suggesting no changes were made.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **No functional changes evident in code files:** For all code files (`webauthnController.ts`, `passkey-utils.ts`, `delete-corrupted-wallet.js`), multiple log entries with very close timestamps show absolutely identical code content. This strongly suggests these entries represent saves without modification, possibly due to IDE auto-saving, formatting on save, or mere logging of file access rather than actual functional changes.
*   **WebAuthn (Passkey) Integration:** Both the backend (`webauthnController.ts`) and frontend utilities (`passkey-utils.ts`) are heavily focused on implementing WebAuthn for secure user authentication and potentially for cryptographic key derivation for wallet operations.
*   **Cryptographic Operations:** The `passkey-utils.ts` file specifically highlights the use of HKDF-SHA256 for key derivation and AES-GCM for encryption, indicating a focus on robust cryptographic practices for wallet security.
*   **Prisma ORM:** The `webauthnController.ts` and `delete-corrupted-wallet.js` files both use Prisma for database interactions, specifically for managing user credentials, wallets, and transactions.
