# Activity Summary for 21/10/2025

## 01:28:43
The following outlines the key changes observed across the project:

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/extension/manifest.json` (Timestamp: 21/10/2025, 00:47:11)**
    *   This file defines a Chrome extension named "Shadow Protocol," version 0.1.0, intended as an "AI-powered autonomous security system for Web3 users on Somnia blockchain."
    *   It specifies a comprehensive set of permissions, including `activeTab`, `storage`, `scripting`, `tabs`, `contextMenus`, `webRequest`, and `notifications`.
    *   Host permissions are set broadly to `https://*/*` and `http://localhost/*`.
    *   The extension uses `background.js` as its service worker, `content.js` for content scripts on all URLs, `popup.html` for its default popup, and `injected.js` as a web-accessible resource. A Content Security Policy is also defined.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/frontend/src/index.css` (Timestamps: 21/10/2025, 00:59:55 - 01:06:04)**
    *   This CSS file defines the core styling and theme for the frontend, utilizing Tailwind CSS.
    *   A significant refactoring occurred around **21/10/2025, 01:03:11**. Earlier versions (`00:59:55`, `01:00:40`, `01:01:15`) contained a less organized structure of CSS variables and un-nested selectors.
    *   The update introduced `@layer base` and `@layer components` directives, organizing global styles (like `:root` variables, `*` border-color, and `body` typography) under `base`, and specific UI component styles (e.g., `shadow-card`, `shadow-btn-primary`, `shadow-input`, `shadow-badge-*`, `shadow-spinner`, `shadow-nav-item`) under `components`.
    *   This refactoring clearly establishes a "Dark + Red design tokens" theme for "Shadow Protocol," defining variables for background, foreground, card, primary (brand red), muted foreground, border, input, and ring colors, along with a default radius.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/frontend/src/pages/Auth/Login.tsx` (Timestamps: 21/10/2025, 01:06:44 - 01:26:56)**
    *   This React component implements the user login interface, supporting both email/password and Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) authentication.
    *   Initial versions (`01:06:44`, `01:07:04`, `01:07:26`, `01:07:33`) used a `formData` state object and simpler class names for styling.
    *   A major structural and functional update happened around **21/10/2025, 01:09:56**. This change:
        *   Switched from a `formData` object to individual `email` and `password` state variables.
        *   Introduced a more structured HTML layout with `<header>` and `<main>` elements.
        *   Implemented new CSS classes like `form-field`, `input-icon`, and `input-action` for better input styling and icon placement.
        *   Added a "Forgot password?" link.
        *   Refined error message display with `p-3 shadow-card-red`.
    *   Between `01:14:33` and `01:24:30`, a minor rendering bug caused a duplication of the `Lock` icon in the password input field, which was resolved in the update at **21/10/2025, 01:25:01**, removing the redundant icon.
    *   All versions consistently include loading indicators (`LoadingSpinner`) and error messages during authentication processes.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **21/10/2025, 00:47:11**: Initial manifest for the Chrome extension, detailing its purpose and technical configuration.
*   **21/10/2025, 01:03:11**: Major refactoring of `index.css` to adopt a more organized Tailwind CSS layer structure, defining the visual theme.
*   **21/10/2025, 01:09:56**: Significant overhaul of the `Login.tsx` component, including state management changes, styling enhancements, and new UI elements.
*   **21/10/2025, 01:25:01**: Fix for a minor UI bug (duplicated icon) in the `Login.tsx` component.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Shadow Protocol Branding and Theme:** A consistent "Shadow Protocol" brand is established with a distinct "Dark + Red" design theme. This is evident through CSS variable definitions (e.g., `--primary: #ff2d2d`) and ubiquitous `shadow-` prefixed custom utility classes (e.g., `shadow-card`, `shadow-btn-primary`, `shadow-input`).
*   **Web3 Integration:** The project heavily features Web3 components, including the "AI-powered autonomous security system for Web3 users on Somnia blockchain" description for the extension and the dual authentication method in the login page which explicitly supports "Connect Wallet" via `window.ethereum` (MetaMask).
*   **Frontend Component-Based Development:** The use of React (`.tsx` files), imports for `LoadingSpinner` and `AuthContext`, and modular CSS patterns (`@layer components`) suggest a robust component-based frontend architecture.
*   **Authentication Focus:** The `Login.tsx` component highlights a strong focus on secure user authentication, supporting both traditional email/password and modern Web3 wallet connections, with built-in loading states and error handling.
*   **Minor Incremental Changes:** Numerous consecutive log entries for the same file, especially in `index.css` and `Login.tsx`, show identical or very similar code, indicating frequent small saves or minor formatting adjustments during active development.

## 02:28:50
**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/extension/manifest.json`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 21/10/2025, 00:47:11
    *   **Summary:** This file defines the manifest for a Chrome extension named "Shadow Protocol" (version 0.1.0). It specifies that the extension is an "AI-powered autonomous security system for Web3 users on Somnia blockchain". It declares numerous permissions including `activeTab`, `storage`, `scripting`, `tabs`, `contextMenus`, `webRequest`, and `notifications`. It sets `host_permissions` to `https://*/*` and `http://localhost/*`, uses `background.js` as a service worker, `content.js` as a content script for all URLs, `popup.html` for its default action, and includes `injected.js` as a web accessible resource. A `content_security_policy` is also defined.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/frontend/src/index.css`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Initial significant changes at 21/10/2025, 00:59:55, with a major refactor at 21/10/2025, 01:03:11.
    *   **Summary:** This file introduces the core styling for the frontend using Tailwind CSS, featuring a "Dark + Red design tokens" theme for "Shadow Protocol."
        *   The initial version (00:59:55) established a comprehensive set of custom CSS variables (e.g., `--background`, `--primary`, `--card`, `--input`) and defined various UI components like cards (`shadow-card`), buttons (`shadow-btn-primary`, `shadow-btn-secondary`, `shadow-btn-outline`), inputs, badges (success, warning, danger, info), animations, a loading spinner, and navigation items.
        *   A significant refactor occurred at 01:03:11, organizing these styles into `@layer base` for global styles and `@layer components` for reusable UI components. This change introduced a dedicated `shadow-btn-connect` button class, consolidated or simplified badge definitions (e.g., explicitly defining only `shadow-badge-danger` in the components layer, implying other badge types or their specific styles were removed or changed in approach), removed explicit animation utility classes (like `animate-fade-in`), and refined input field styling including placeholder colors. Subsequent updates to this file were identical to the refactored version, suggesting minor saves or no functional changes.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/frontend/src/pages/Auth/Login.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Initial structure at 21/10/2025, 01:06:44, with a significant refactor at 21/10/2025, 01:09:56.
    *   **Summary:** This React component handles user login, supporting both traditional email/password and Web3 wallet authentication.
        *   The initial version (01:06:44) set up state for form data, password visibility, loading, errors, and wallet connection status. It integrated with an `AuthContext` for login and wallet connection logic, navigating to `/dashboard` upon success. It included UI elements for input fields with icons, password toggle, a "Connect Wallet" button with a spinner, and error display.
        *   A major refactor at 01:09:56 streamlined the component by separating `formData` into individual `email` and `password` states. It also significantly restructured the UI, introducing more semantic `form-field`, `input-icon`, and `input-action` CSS classes, and added a "Forgot password?" link.
        *   Subsequent changes involved minor adjustments and corrections to icon placement within input fields (e.g., re-adding a mail icon, correcting a duplicated lock icon) and managing placeholder text. The overall functionality and core logic remained consistent.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/backend/src/server.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Initial comprehensive setup at 21/10/2025, 01:50:29, with a minor update at 21/10/2025, 01:50:39.
    *   **Summary:** This file configures and starts the backend Express server for Shadow Protocol.
        *   The initial version (01:50:29) implemented standard backend practices, including loading environment variables, setting up various middleware (security with `helmet`, CORS, `compression`, `express-rate-limit`, JSON/URL-encoded body parsing), and Winston for logging. It established a MongoDB connection using Mongoose, defined API routes (auth, analysis, contracts, social, rewards, deadman), and included a health check endpoint. Crucially, it set up a Socket.IO server to handle real-time features like transaction analysis and contract monitoring, with a CORS policy that can be broadly allowed in development or explicitly configured.
        *   A minor but notable change at 01:50:39 updated the CORS policy to be more lenient during development (`process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`) by automatically allowing all origins when not in production.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/backend/src/config/contracts.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Initial creation at 21/10/2025, 01:54:22.
    *   **Summary:** This file defines the blockchain contract configurations for the Shadow Protocol. It specifies `CONTRACT_ADDRESSES` for the `somniaTestnet`, including `chainId`, `rpcUrl`, and deployed addresses for `shadowProtocol` and `shadowToken`, along with a `blockExplorer` URL. It also contains extensive `CONTRACT_ABIS` for `shadowProtocol` (detailing its constructor, events like `AssetDeposited`, `BeneficiaryAdded`, `DeadManSwitchTriggered`, and functions for asset management, beneficiary settings, and dead man switch control) and a partial ABI for `shadowToken` (including its constructor and events like `AnalysisReward`, `Approval`). All subsequent entries for this file show identical content, indicating no functional changes after its initial definition.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Project Focus:** The changes consistently revolve around the "Shadow Protocol" blockchain project, encompassing a backend, frontend, and browser extension.
*   **Consistent Naming:** The prefix "Shadow" is frequently used for component names and CSS classes (e.g., `Shadow Protocol`, `shadow-card`, `shadow-btn-primary`, `shadow-input`, `ShadowProtocol` contract).
*   **Web3 Integration:** Strong emphasis on Web3 features, including MetaMask wallet connectivity, smart contract interactions (Somnia testnet), and blockchain-related functionalities like transaction analysis and dead man switches.
*   **Security and Robustness:** The backend demonstrates a focus on security (Helmet, CORS policies, rate limiting) and operational stability (Winston logging, graceful shutdown).
*   **Frontend Design System:** The frontend utilizes a component-based design approach with a dark, red-accented theme, indicating a cohesive visual identity.
*   **Iterative Development/Refinement:** Several files, especially `index.css` and `Login.tsx`, show multiple entries over short periods. This indicates an iterative development process with frequent saves and refinements, particularly in UI/UX and styling, rather than large, infrequent commits. Some changes were reverted or immediately corrected in subsequent commits (e.g., input icons in `Login.tsx`).
*   **Configuration Management:** Environment variables (`.env` files) are used for sensitive information like API keys and database URIs, highlighting a standard practice for configuration.

## 03:51:07
The changes log details development across the `Shadow` blockchain project, encompassing backend contract configurations, frontend wallet utilities, user authentication, API service definitions, and overall project setup.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/backend/src/config/contracts.ts` (Timestamp: 21/10/2025, 02:50:53)**
    This file defines core contract configurations for the `somniaTestnet`, including its `chainId`, `rpcUrl`, `shadowProtocol` and `shadowToken` addresses, and `blockExplorer`. Crucially, it exports extensive Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs) for `shadowProtocol` (detailing constructor, numerous events like `AssetDeposited`, `BeneficiaryAdded`, `DeadManSwitchTriggered`, and functions like `depositAsset`, `getBeneficiaries`, `triggerDeadManSwitch`) and a partial ABI for `shadowToken` (including `AnalysisReward`, `Approval` events). This entry appears to be a foundational setup for interacting with the deployed smart contracts.

2.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/frontend/src/utils/wallet.ts` (Timestamps: 21/10/2025, 02:51:06 - 03:01:43)**
    This utility file provides helpers for Web3 wallet interactions.
    *   Initially (02:51:06, 02:51:19), it contained functions to `detectInjectedProviders`, `getProviderName`, `requestAccounts`, `getChainId`, `ensureChain` (for switching/adding chains), and `personalSign`. These functions used `any` for provider types due to varying injected provider interfaces.
    *   A significant update at `02:58:27` introduced more robust error handling for `requestAccounts` and `personalSign` (specifically for user rejections, error code `4001`). It also added a new function, `selectProviderAndRequestAccounts`, which attempts to smartly select a provider and request accounts, providing specific user messages for rejections and falling back to iterating through detected providers.
    *   Further minor changes at `03:01:38` and `03:01:43` added a `console.log` statement to `requestAccounts` for debugging.
    The overall pattern for this file indicates a continuous effort to refine and improve the reliability and user experience of connecting and interacting with various injected Web3 wallets.

3.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/frontend/src/pages/Auth/Login.tsx` (Timestamps: 21/10/2025, 02:51:57 - 02:58:07)**
    This React component manages the user login interface, supporting both email/password and Web3 wallet authentication.
    *   Early versions (02:51:57 - 02:54:51) showed basic wallet connection logic, directly detecting providers and requesting accounts.
    *   A major update at `02:55:06` integrated a new `WalletPicker` component and introduced state to manage its visibility (`showWalletPicker`, `pickerProviders`). The `handleWalletConnect` function was modified to present the `WalletPicker` if multiple injected providers were detected, allowing the user to choose. New `handlePickerSelect` and `handlePickerCancel` functions were added to manage this new UI flow. This change included an accidental duplicate `useState` import, which persisted through subsequent minor timestamp entries.
    *   At `02:56:09`, the `handleWalletConnect` logic was further refined to leverage the `selectProviderAndRequestAccounts` utility function (from `wallet.ts`) for an initial attempt, falling back to the multi-provider `WalletPicker` if the initial selection process failed.
    *   The component's JSX was updated at `02:56:17` to conditionally render the `WalletPicker`.
    The changes here demonstrate an evolving strategy for wallet integration, moving towards a more user-friendly experience by offering a selection mechanism when multiple wallets are present, and adopting new utility functions from `wallet.ts`.

4.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json` (Timestamp: 21/10/2025, 03:02:25)**
    This is a user-specific Visual Studio Code settings file. It configures editor preferences, extensions, terminal settings, and various development environment behaviors, including theme, auto-save, confirmation prompts, language-specific formatting, and tool-related commands (e.g., `zencoder.shellTool.allowedCommands`, `chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove`). This file reflects the developer's local setup rather than project code.

5.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/frontend/src/services/api.ts` (Timestamps: 21/10/2025, 03:03:28 - 03:05:34)**
    This file defines an Axios instance configured to interact with the backend API, including request/response interceptors for handling authentication tokens and 401 errors (redirecting to login). It exports structured API access objects for:
    *   `authAPI`: User registration, login, wallet connection, and SIWE (Sign-In with Ethereum) nonce and verification.
    *   `deadmanAPI`: Creating, retrieving, checking in, triggering, and updating "Dead Man Switch" configurations with details on beneficiaries, assets, and trigger conditions.
    *   `analysisAPI`: Analyzing blockchain transactions and contracts.
    *   `rewardsAPI`: Managing user rewards (creation, retrieval, claiming, bulk creation) for various activities.
    *   `socialAPI`: Creating, retrieving, updating, and resolving social alerts for platforms like Twitter, Discord, Telegram, related to security incidents or contract updates.
    All entries for this file are identical, indicating that the API service definitions remained stable during these timestamps.

6.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/backend/src/routes/auth.ts` (Timestamp: 21/10/2025, 03:06:11)**
    This backend route file implements authentication functionalities. It uses `express`, `bcryptjs`, `jsonwebtoken`, `express-validator` for request validation, and `express-rate-limit` to prevent brute-force attacks on auth endpoints. It features:
    *   A `nonce` endpoint for SIWE authentication, generating and managing single-use nonces with a 5-minute TTL.
    *   `register` and `login` endpoints for traditional email/password authentication, including password hashing, JWT generation, and user management.
    *   `wallet-connect` and `siwe` endpoints for Web3 wallet-based authentication, verifying signatures using `ethers.verifyMessage` and enforcing checks for "Somnia" chain context in the signed message to prevent cross-chain replay attacks. New users are created with placeholder emails if they only connect via wallet. `winston` logging is integrated for auth events.

7.  **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/package.json` (Timestamps: 21/10/2025, 03:06:24 - 03:07:33)**
    This is the main project configuration file, describing "shadow-protocol" as an "AI-powered autonomous security system for Web3 users on Somnia blockchain". It defines a monorepo structure with workspaces for "extension", "backend", and "contracts". It includes `npm` scripts for installing, building, testing, developing, and linting across these workspaces, as well as metadata like keywords, author, license, and repository links. All entries for this file are identical, indicating a stable project structure and dependency list throughout these timestamps.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Wallet Integration Focus:** There's a strong and evolving focus on robust Web3 wallet integration, particularly in the frontend `wallet.ts` utilities and the `Login.tsx` component. This includes handling multiple injected providers and user rejection scenarios.
*   **Security Emphasis:** Both frontend (e.g., wallet signature messages including chain context) and backend (e.g., `express-rate-limit`, `ethers.verifyMessage` checks, nonce management for SIWE) changes highlight a strong emphasis on security for authentication and contract interaction.
*   **Monorepo Structure:** The `package.json` consistently indicates a monorepo approach, organizing the project into `extension`, `backend`, and `contracts` workspaces, suggesting a cohesive, multi-part application.
*   **Timestamp Consistency:** Many files show identical content across multiple timestamps within a short period, implying frequent saving or version control commits without functional changes, particularly for `Login.tsx` (before its major overhaul), `wallet.ts` (before its error handling and `selectProvider` additions), `api.ts`, and `package.json`.
*   **Development Practices:** The `settings.json` file points to a developer's setup for coding, testing, and Git operations, indicating standard software development lifecycle practices. The `console.log` addition in `wallet.ts` also suggests active debugging.
*   **Minor Inconsistencies:** The `Login.tsx` file repeatedly shows a duplicate `import { useState } from 'react'` after the major update, which is a minor code artifact.

## 04:11:53
The `README.md` file for the `spacelink` project was initialized or updated on 21/10/2025 at 03:12:03, containing only the title "SpaceLink".

A significant update occurred on 21/10/2025 at 03:23:09 to the `/app/satellite-operator/dashboard/page.tsx` file. This file defines the `SatelliteDashboardPage` component, which serves as a comprehensive dashboard for satellite operators. Key functionalities and design patterns include:

*   **Data Management:** The dashboard leverages `useAppData` to fetch `satellites` and `bookings`, and `useWallet` for managing the connected user's blockchain address and chain status.
*   **User Interface:** It features a sophisticated layout with a `CesiumGlobe` component for visualizing satellites and a detailed information card. The globe utilizes a `NEXT_PUBLIC_CESIUM_ION_TOKEN` environment variable for configuration.
*   **Wallet Integration:** A `WalletButton` is present for connection, and a "Switch Chain" button appears if the user is not on the preferred blockchain network.
*   **Satellite Overview:** A table displays registered satellites, including their name, frequency, cost per MB, and active status.
*   **Pass Management:** The dashboard includes a `SatellitePassesList` component that shows passes booked for the operator's satellites. This list integrates custom hooks (`useConfirmPass`, `useCancelPass`) to allow operators to confirm or cancel booked passes. Pass statuses are color-coded for clarity (e.g., Booked, Verified, Cancelled).
*   **Hooks & Context:** The component heavily relies on custom hooks (e.g., `useAppData`, `useWallet`, `useConfirmPass`, `useCancelPass`, `useUpdateSatellite`, `useDeactivateSatellite`) and context providers, indicating a well-structured application for managing blockchain-related data and interactions within the "SpaceLink" domain.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS classes are extensively used for styling the dashboard's elements.

The most substantial change log entry is the comprehensive `page.tsx` update, indicating the development of core UI and blockchain interaction logic for satellite operators. The recurring pattern is the use of context providers (`AppDataContext`, `WalletContext`) and domain-specific hooks for managing state and interacting with the blockchain.
