# Activity Summary for 21/10/2025

## 01:28:43
The following outlines the key changes observed across the project:

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/extension/manifest.json` (Timestamp: 21/10/2025, 00:47:11)**
    *   This file defines a Chrome extension named "Shadow Protocol," version 0.1.0, intended as an "AI-powered autonomous security system for Web3 users on Somnia blockchain."
    *   It specifies a comprehensive set of permissions, including `activeTab`, `storage`, `scripting`, `tabs`, `contextMenus`, `webRequest`, and `notifications`.
    *   Host permissions are set broadly to `https://*/*` and `http://localhost/*`.
    *   The extension uses `background.js` as its service worker, `content.js` for content scripts on all URLs, `popup.html` for its default popup, and `injected.js` as a web-accessible resource. A Content Security Policy is also defined.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/frontend/src/index.css` (Timestamps: 21/10/2025, 00:59:55 - 01:06:04)**
    *   This CSS file defines the core styling and theme for the frontend, utilizing Tailwind CSS.
    *   A significant refactoring occurred around **21/10/2025, 01:03:11**. Earlier versions (`00:59:55`, `01:00:40`, `01:01:15`) contained a less organized structure of CSS variables and un-nested selectors.
    *   The update introduced `@layer base` and `@layer components` directives, organizing global styles (like `:root` variables, `*` border-color, and `body` typography) under `base`, and specific UI component styles (e.g., `shadow-card`, `shadow-btn-primary`, `shadow-input`, `shadow-badge-*`, `shadow-spinner`, `shadow-nav-item`) under `components`.
    *   This refactoring clearly establishes a "Dark + Red design tokens" theme for "Shadow Protocol," defining variables for background, foreground, card, primary (brand red), muted foreground, border, input, and ring colors, along with a default radius.

*   **`/Users/tanishqmaheshwari/code/blockchain/Shadow/frontend/src/pages/Auth/Login.tsx` (Timestamps: 21/10/2025, 01:06:44 - 01:26:56)**
    *   This React component implements the user login interface, supporting both email/password and Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) authentication.
    *   Initial versions (`01:06:44`, `01:07:04`, `01:07:26`, `01:07:33`) used a `formData` state object and simpler class names for styling.
    *   A major structural and functional update happened around **21/10/2025, 01:09:56**. This change:
        *   Switched from a `formData` object to individual `email` and `password` state variables.
        *   Introduced a more structured HTML layout with `<header>` and `<main>` elements.
        *   Implemented new CSS classes like `form-field`, `input-icon`, and `input-action` for better input styling and icon placement.
        *   Added a "Forgot password?" link.
        *   Refined error message display with `p-3 shadow-card-red`.
    *   Between `01:14:33` and `01:24:30`, a minor rendering bug caused a duplication of the `Lock` icon in the password input field, which was resolved in the update at **21/10/2025, 01:25:01**, removing the redundant icon.
    *   All versions consistently include loading indicators (`LoadingSpinner`) and error messages during authentication processes.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **21/10/2025, 00:47:11**: Initial manifest for the Chrome extension, detailing its purpose and technical configuration.
*   **21/10/2025, 01:03:11**: Major refactoring of `index.css` to adopt a more organized Tailwind CSS layer structure, defining the visual theme.
*   **21/10/2025, 01:09:56**: Significant overhaul of the `Login.tsx` component, including state management changes, styling enhancements, and new UI elements.
*   **21/10/2025, 01:25:01**: Fix for a minor UI bug (duplicated icon) in the `Login.tsx` component.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Shadow Protocol Branding and Theme:** A consistent "Shadow Protocol" brand is established with a distinct "Dark + Red" design theme. This is evident through CSS variable definitions (e.g., `--primary: #ff2d2d`) and ubiquitous `shadow-` prefixed custom utility classes (e.g., `shadow-card`, `shadow-btn-primary`, `shadow-input`).
*   **Web3 Integration:** The project heavily features Web3 components, including the "AI-powered autonomous security system for Web3 users on Somnia blockchain" description for the extension and the dual authentication method in the login page which explicitly supports "Connect Wallet" via `window.ethereum` (MetaMask).
*   **Frontend Component-Based Development:** The use of React (`.tsx` files), imports for `LoadingSpinner` and `AuthContext`, and modular CSS patterns (`@layer components`) suggest a robust component-based frontend architecture.
*   **Authentication Focus:** The `Login.tsx` component highlights a strong focus on secure user authentication, supporting both traditional email/password and modern Web3 wallet connections, with built-in loading states and error handling.
*   **Minor Incremental Changes:** Numerous consecutive log entries for the same file, especially in `index.css` and `Login.tsx`, show identical or very similar code, indicating frequent small saves or minor formatting adjustments during active development.
